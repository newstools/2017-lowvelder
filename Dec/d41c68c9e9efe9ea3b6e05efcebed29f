 MBOMBELA – After being denied bail in the Lowveld’s regional courts, alleged poacher Rodney Landela was granted bail in the Mpumalanga High Court last Friday. Judge Francis Legodi fixed bail at R20 000, which was paid. Landela, a Kruger National Park (KNP) regional ranger, has been on trial since July last year along with his co-accused, Kenneth Motshotsho. Their case will continue on 12 and 14 December in the Skukuza Regional Court. The two were arrested after a white rhino was poached in the Kingfisherspruit area. Both its horns had been removed. The two accused were connected to the poaching after bloodied shoes were apparently found in the vehicle Motshotsho was driving. It was reported that a SANParks firearm had been used in the poaching.
