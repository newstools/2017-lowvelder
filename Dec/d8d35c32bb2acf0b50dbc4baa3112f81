SKUKUZA – A male leopard that suffered from a snare being around his neck for at least a month was rescued in the Kruger National Park earlier this week.
The sighting was reported to Lize Bester of the Facebook group “Enough is Enough” on November 9 and the information was relayed to officials in the park. They spent a week searching, but could not find him.
No further sightings were reported and the animal was believed to have succumbed to the seemingly severe wound around his neck.
On Sunday afternoon, however, a snared leopard was spotted again on the H2-2, outside Pretoriuskop between S14 and S20. It was lying on the road, a severe wound visible. “It almost looked as if it was asking for help,” a visitor commented.
Soon it was established that it was the same animal. It was recognised on two horizontal, two vertical and again two horizontal dots next to its eye. It also has a distinctive black mark on its left eyebrow. According to a field guide, it was a well-known male leopard, one of triplets. They used to call him and his sister “the arrows” because of a V on their chins.
When he was spotted, someone stayed nearby until a ranger from Pretoriuskop had been fetched and veterinarian Dr Peter Buss was dispatched from Skukuza. Fortunately the leopard did not move off and it could be darted, assessed and treated.
Buss worked tirelessly on Sunday night to remove the snare and treat the wound. The leopard is now sporting a “blue collar”, caused by the antibiotics used to treat infections and serves to prevent further infection.
The wound was found not to be too deep, and the healthy-looking leopard was already spotted in a tree again the next day.
