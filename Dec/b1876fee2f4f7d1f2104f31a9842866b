 MBOMBELA – On Friday night SPAR succeeded in bringing people together for the spirit of Christmas with a brand-new carolling event. A large LED Christmas tree lit the cloudy sky in a picnic-style event aimed at giving back to charities across the city, thus the entry fee was a toy. Additionally, candles were sold for the benefit of Pro-Life Pet Rescue. Gibraltar, the much-loved six-man rock and blues band, together with the Casterbridge Music Development Academy entertained the merry crowd. People brought picnic baskets and enjoyed Christmas classics, fun songs and even got on stage to sing.
Group marketing director of SPAR, Mike Prentice said they wanted to create a beautiful and iconic statement in a public place which could be enjoyed by both residents and visitors, “We wanted the tree to be 100 per cent made in South Africa and lit by a multitude of LED lights – all locally designed and manufactured. We want to revisit the nostalgia of Christmas and create a beautiful and iconic statement in a public place.” The 13-metre high, seven-metre wide, custom-made Christmas tree is located in the middle of The Grove Shopping Centre and it will bring cheer all festive season long. With Father Christmas’ arrival drawing near, revellers agreed that this show ignited the spirit of Christmas.
