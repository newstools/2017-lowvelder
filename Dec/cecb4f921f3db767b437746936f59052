 The three restaurants in the Kruger National Park (KNP) that had been closed for months are opening again this week. The restaurant at Letaba is operational since Wednesday December 13, with the one at Satara opening on Thursday December 14 and in Olifants Camp patrons can make use of the restaurant again from Friday December 15. Subsequent to the resolution of the dispute that existed between South African National Parks (SANParks) and Ringgold, the company that managed those restaurants, SANParks has appointed one of the companies that currently manages other restaurants in the park to manage these three facilities on temporary basis for the next six months while the tender process to find new operators is being undertaken. “All of our accommodations are also equipped with kitchen and braai facilities should visitors to the three rest camps wish to self-cater,” said the SANParks managing executive of tourism development and marketing, Hapiloe Sello.  “We thank you for your patience during this time and we do apologise to our visitors for the inconvenience caused over the last couple of months.”
