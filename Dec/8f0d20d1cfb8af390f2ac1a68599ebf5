According to Shaun Terblanche of J&M Security, the robbers were travelling in four vehicles: a white Audi with registration HPY 261 MP and three white Mercedes-Benz. They blocked the Fidelity van at a speed bump, causing it to come to a halt. The two vehicles behind the van opened fire. They forced the occupants from the van and blasted the safe open. They made off with an undisclosed amount of cash.  A group of people rushed to the deserted vehicle‚ scrambling to pick up the leftover cash from the crime scene. The suspects fled with an undisclosed amount of money and firearms taken off the Fidelity guards. Terblanche said guards had been collecting cash from a client when they were attacked.
