  It’s not very common to see a lone female lion hanging around since lions are the only species in the cat kingdom that live in family units called prides. One reason for her solitary existence could have been due to male lions taking over her pride and forcing her out. She was clearly unable to hunt alone without any fellow members and she was starving and weak. Bathabile Shakwane, 22-year-old field guide, explains her sighting: “We were just leisurely driving down from Satara towards Skukuza on a relatively hot day. We were rewarded with lots of buffalo sightings. We stopped in at Kumana dam and happened to notice a lone lion lying in the bushes nearby a herd of buffalo. A single buffalo bull seemed to notice the lion lying in the bushes and decided to tread carefully towards the lion to see what she was up to! At a point, the buffalo got a bit too close for comfort and the lion got a fright and tried to flee the situation. Once she got up, we noticed how terribly thin and weak she was looking and then I realised that this meal was a matter of life and death for her. Unfortunately, in the condition she was in there was no chance she would be able to take down a healthy buffalo of that size on her own. The buffalo realised her vulnerable state and flung her up into the air like a ragdoll. She managed to get away from the buffalo unscathed. It was clear, though, that lion was not going to live much longer on her own and I can only imagine she would have died of hunger at the end of the day. The video is kind of tragic, but just that scene was beyond amazing for me because you don’t get to see this every day.”
