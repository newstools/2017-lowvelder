 GRASKOP – The opening of the much-anticipated Graskop Gorge viewing lift is scheduled for mid-December. Also read: Wetland polluted with bacteria The main attraction is the viewing lift that takes visitors 51 metres down the face of the gorge and into the forest below, where a wooden walkway and suspension bridges will take visitors along a 500-metre interpretation trail through the indigenous forest.  The forest environment and its importance are interpreted through a series of large panels, beautifully designed and illustrated by Lesley Lane of Hamilton-Fynch. Also read: Monkeys’ aggression caused by human inconsideration These panels are installed at strategic points along the trail, covering elements such as birds of the forest, biodiversity, fabulous fungi, tree communication and much more.
