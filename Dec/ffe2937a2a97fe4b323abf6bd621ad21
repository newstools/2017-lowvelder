MBOMBELA – “If you want to do your child a favour, don’t invest in traditional markets. Buy them a Bitcoin or a percentage of one and let it lie idle, because in 18 years’ time you will have more than enough money to pay for a good education,” says Cisco van Heerden, founder and owner of NGC Technologies in Mbombela.
