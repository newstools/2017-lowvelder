 While toll gates on the N4 as well as the Lebombo Border Post experienced normal traffic this morning (Friday December 15), an increase is expected this afternoon and tonight. According to Solange Soares-Nicholson, communications manager at Trans African Concessions (TRAC), they expect that the N4 toll route will get extremely busy from 12:00 onwards, with the Middelburg Plaza the busiest as usually. “Fortunately the plazas are now tag compliant, which should speed up the thoroughfare considerably,” she said. All construction work on the route has been stopped for the festive season and will only commence again on January 15.  “The Elands Valley is completely open, and stop and go control points are not in operation currently. They will only be active for one or two days in next week, and closed again over the festive days,” Soares-Nicholson said. Ms Patheka Vikwa from Home Affairs at the Lebombo Border Post said this morning that this post between South Africa and Mozambique was “actually quieter than expected” at the time. She anticipated though that it would become much busier during the afternoon and towards tonight. Both officials urged travellers to plan and time their journeys properly to enhance the flow of traffic and safety on the roads.
