 Of the six basic spirits that are used in cocktail-making, gin is the most versatile. Its distinct herb and spice aromatics enable it to blend well with a range of liqueurs and fruit juices and even other spirits. Add to that its colourlessness which makes it a neutral background for festive looking creations.    No cocktail recipe is more argued over than the classic Dry Martini. It basically consists of two measures of ice-cold gin to one measure ice-cold dry white vermouth. The drink should be mixed gently in a jug (stirred not shaken), with ice, and then strained into the traditional martini glass, which should come out of the freezer. Add a twist of lemon rind or one or two green olives skewered on a toothpick. A variation of this martini is the Gibson where two white cocktail pearl onions skewered on a toothpick are added in stead of the olives or lemon rind.    2 measures / 2 Tblsp gin 3 measures / 4 Tblsp pineapple juice 2 measures / 2 Tblsp grapefruit juice 1/2 measure / 2 tsp grenadine Shake all the ingredients well, with ice, in a cocktail shaker and strain into a tall glass.    2 measures / 2 Tblsp gin 2 measures / 2 Tblsp dry vermouth 1/4 measure / 1 tsp grenadine dash cointreau dash orange juice Shake well, with ice, in a cocktail shaker and strain into a glass.
