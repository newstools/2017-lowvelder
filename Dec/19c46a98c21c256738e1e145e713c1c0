 MBOMBELA – It is official: the best support base in the South African Army is located right here in the city. SA Army Support Base Mpumalanga (ASB MP) was acknowledged as the best support base during the annual SA Army Support Formation awards ceremony, held in Thaba Tshwane last month. The prestigious trophy was presented to Lt Col Coen van Heerden, the officer commanding ASB Mpumalanga, by the chief of staff of the SA Army Support Formation, Brig Gen Hein Stroebel. “Taking the wide variety of functions into consideration, it is clear that only a comprehensive team effort can bring this success,” Van Heerden said.

Being crowned as the top support base was a career highlight for all the members who contributed to winning the trophy. The challenge now is to retain it.” All the support bases were evaluated throughout the year on the different fields of support rendered to other military units in Mpumalanga, their client units. They were also judged according to other criteria, determined by the general officer commanding of the SA Army Support Formation, Maj Gen Luvuyo Nobanda. “ASB MP itself is a big military unit, and providing internal support is a big task on its own,” said Van Heerden.
