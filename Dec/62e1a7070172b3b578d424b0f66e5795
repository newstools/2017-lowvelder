 MBOMBELA – Dr Mathews Phosa will appear in the South Gauteng High Court today. The presidential hopeful wants the court to set aside the results of the provincial general council which saw “Unity” receive more votes than the preferred leadership candidates earlier this month. Phosa also want the dissolution of the provincial executive committee. He has approached the Gauteng court because he does not trust the courts in Mpumalanga.  “You cannot trust someone from Mpumalanga because some of them are captured by DD (provincial chairman, David Mabuza),” Phosa’s campaign coordinator, Ronnie Malomane, told Lowvelder.
“We do not want our case undermined, whereas we take it seriously. We want to be free,” he added. “Unity” received the most nominations after delegates wrote it down on their ballot papers in the place of abstentions or candidates’ names and surnames. “The province has fought hard for unity and the branches have listened,” said Mabuza after the results announcement. When queried what or who “Unity” represented, Mabuza replied by saying it was the bedrock of the ANC. Mabuza received 185 nominations for position of deputy president. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma received 123 nomination for president.  Phosa also submitted a list of demands to the party that he wants addressed. Malomane said they could not divulge the demands as the matter was sub judice. ANC spokesman Sasekani Manzini has decried Phosa’s actions and said he should have taken his grievances to his branch general meeting. “The guidelines are clear. You must lodge your dispute at the branch and not the province, and it must be lodged within 48 hours,” said Manzini. When asked by this publication why he did not bring the matter up with his ward in White River, Malomane said there were disputes in the ward. The disputes were pending and as a result he does not believe the matter would be entertained.
