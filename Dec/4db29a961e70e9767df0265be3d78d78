I have encouraged my pupils to think outside the box and to experiment with different mediums such as acrylic, watercolour and inks for painting and illustration. I also taught them different drawing techniques, which included the use of pencil and charcoal.” According to her, the pupils did exceptionally well at this year’s eisteddfod. Regarding her method of teaching, Nel said:”Before I start a project, I give the pupils a general background of the artistic style or cultural artwork we will be working in, so that they have some context behind what they are doing. She continued,”Art plays a very important role in a child’s development, especially in today’s day and age, where children are so bombarded with visual media that it sometimes becomes overwhelming. I encourage the pupils to use their imagination and am always very pleasantly surprised with the overall results. Being creative relaxes children, helping them to discover themselves. In class, I try to make their projects fun and exploratory.” Information provided by HCN Art Studio Nelspruit
