WHITE RIVER &#8211; Cameron Meyer&#8217;s friends from Penryn Prep seem to be more excited about his new wheelchair than he is. The grade three pupil has a condition called spastic diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy that causes constant stiffness in the lower body and affects the legs. For this reason he needs aid to walk long distances.
