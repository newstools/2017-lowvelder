MBOMBELA &#8211; This is not only because of his dominance on the track and field over recent years: Norbert is also well known for his bubbly personality and naughty streak.Tactical battles await Norbert when he competes at the South African Schools Athletic Championships (Sasac) in Durban tomorrow.Maudas Banda (long jump, 7,50 metres) and Tlotliso Leotlela (100 metres, 10,12 seconds) will be Norbert&#8217;s fiercest competitors, but Norbert will be one of the favourites to win gold at Kings Park Athletics Stadium.He spoke to Lowvelder about his dire circumstances growing up. He relayed memories in a poignant way.&#8220;There was a lot of domestic violence at home. I don&#8217;t remember a night going by that there was no fighting.Growing up, violence seemed like the only way to sort out any conflict. I must admit that I changed schools on a regular basis because I didn&#8217;t know how to channel my anger.&#8221;Norbert, the youngest of three children, was born in Mbombela.For the first two years of primary school he was enrolled at Valencia Combined School, thereafter he was sent to Johannesburg to live with his aunt.She sent him and his brother back to the Lowveld where he attended two different schools before going to high school. In the following two years he attended three different schools in the area.&#8220;I enrolled at Lowveld High in the second term of grade nine. My coach Johan (Kruger) has taught me so much, not only about athletics, but also about life. Without him I would not be where I am today,&#8221; said Norbert.Norbert Ponisammy and his coach Johan Kruger.The end to his 2016 athletics season was emotional. He tore a hamstring at the Mussa championships in Secunda and was unable to compete in the final at Sasac in Bloemfontein.&#8220;I was very optimistic. I didn&#8217;t train before going to Bloem as I thought by then I would be fine. During the 100-metre heats, I got a second degree tear. I cried. But being unable to compete humbled me. It reminded me that anything can happen.&#8221;Also read: Three gold medals for NorbertThis year he is the only athlete from the Lowveld who qualified for three events: long jump, 100 and 200 metres.The speedster boasts a personal best time in the 100 metres of 10,17 seconds and distance of 7,53 metres in the long jump.

If I can jump 7,80 metres, that will be great.&#8220;But wait! Let me first tell you my story of how I became an athlete. I was at an interhouse meeting, but I didn&#8217;t compete. I sat on the pavilion and saw the smiles on the athletes&#8217; faces when they walked around with their medals around their necks. I paid one of my mates R10 for his medal. I told my mother that it was mine and her face lit up like a candle. At a following meeting, I ran my first ever 80 metres and I fainted.&#8221;He calls this incident his little miracle.&#8220;After a week in hospital, I came back an athlete. I was determined to compete again. After my third race, I got one medal after the other.&#8221; He dreams of becoming a professional athlete. The day of a meeting is like a drug to me. Running. The crowds. And wow! That green and gold vest&#8230; what an honour it will be to put the SA flag over my shoulders.&#8221;It is rumoured that Norbert will be going to Bloemfontein next year to train with Olympic gold medallist, Wayde van Niekerk&#8217;s coach, Ans Botha.Also read: Athletes commitment to excellence pays off&nbsp;Interesting facts Winning time/distance for u/19 boys at SA&#8217;s in 2016 100 metres &#8211; 10,45 that was set by Kristiaan de Wet Long jump &#8211; Crissio Roberts took gold with a distance of 7,25 metres.Norbert Ponisammy and Frank Muwayi.
