As the concessionaire of the N4 Toll Route, Trans African Concessions (TRAC) believes that the introduction of automated electronic tag payments on the route will make travelling on the Maputo Corridor easier and more convenient.This cashless payment system will go live on the South African section of the route, between Solomon Mahlangu offramp in Gauteng and the Lebombo Border Post in Komatipoort, on 1 March. In view of this, TRAC encourages its concession holders and frequent discount users who are already in possession of an automated electronic tag to make full use of it on our road by linking the tag to their existing TRAC Account.ALSO READ: N4 toll route tariff adjustments 2017Account holders can simply visit the mainline plaza they are affiliated to, taking along their 16 digit automated electronic tag number, and request the linkage.
