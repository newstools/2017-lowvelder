She could have lived a wonderful life in Mozambique.&#8221; Carlos admitted that she had caused a lot of drama with his friends and family. &#8220;The business and place are now better that she is not here. I am also mending ties with my family,&#8221; he said.Carlos knew that the police were investigating Maria in connection with her previous husband&#8217;s murder, but at the time he believed she was innocent. &#8220;I think at one stage they even tapped my phone.&#8221; On Maria&#8217;s Facebook profile, under the name Marietjie Ferreira, she openly showed she was an unhappy person, especially in her marriage.

One minute she loved me, the next she wanted to leave me,&#8221; Carlos said. Maria&#8217;s arrest on Sunday came as a shock. The couple was visiting friends in White River. One of the friends, who spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity, said both were relaxed. His wife accompanied Maria to the filling station, when suddenly the police appeared and arrested her. According to Hawks spokesman, Capt Dineo Sekgotodi, this was immediately after she paid an undercover police agent who was to assist her in killing her husband. The case was postponed until Monday for her bail application.
