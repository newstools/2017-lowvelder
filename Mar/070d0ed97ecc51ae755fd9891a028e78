BARBERTON &#8211; A local Christian mission has come under fire after it was accused of issuing bogus theology degrees. Prospective preachers of independent churches across Africa receive their training at the Back to the Bible Mission (BBM.)Unlike traditional protestant churches, the independent spreading of the gospel is not necessarily regulated by a synod and the law. Yet the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) called BBM a &#8220;bogus bible college&#8221; as it is not DHET accredited. &#8220;Do we need government to accredit teachings of God&#8217;s word?&#8221; theologians have asked.Also read: The most violent provinces of South Africa The mission, a non-profit organisation, operates in Barberton&#8217;s Sheba Valley.Its director is Dr Shai Mulder. His wife, Dr Elr za Mulder, is head of the mission department. &#8220;Students from 24 African countries study free of charge. Those who live on our premises pay R400 per month for board and lodging,&#8221; he said.Dr Shai and Dr Elr za Mulder.Last week, former students reported being promised degrees. Yet after completing their studies, they were dismayed to discover that they would not receive any.&#8220;We never said that we offer degrees,&#8221; Shai told Lowvelder on Friday.Also read: Contractors testify that Lily mine ignored instability warnings Yet on January 30, 2014, Elr za was caught on video saying that students could obtain BTh degrees. When questioned about this, Shai said that his wife had in fact meant that the information BBM passes onto its students &#8220;may contribute towards them obtaining degrees&#8221;.This photo of mission students was shared on Facebook.He explained that these degrees would be obtained elsewhere.The three-year course at BBM consists of short courses on, among others, each of the books of the Bible. Students are issued attendance certificates.&#8220;A few years ago they said they wanted degrees. An institute called Calvary did at that time recognise some of our students&#8217; prior learning and issue them degrees.&#8221; However, the DHET&#8217;s Dr Shaheeda Essack maintains Calvary exists only on the Internet. &#8220;BBM and Calvary ended their affiliation. After this, Hebron Bible College (in Benoni) recognised prior learning done at BBM,&#8221; Shai said. Hebron has since distanced itself from BBM after being ordered to do so by the DHET.A photo of the mission grounds shared on Facebook.Mulder believes that the department is hell-bent on denying Christian colleges academic accreditation.The purpose of this and registration with DHET is to ensure that private institutions offer quality education, to protect the public against bogus operators and to ensure that students meet qualifications that are aligned with the Higher Education Qualifications Framework (HEQF), and adhere to the Higher Education Act.Without accreditation, institutions may not offer higher-education programmes.According to police records, the department has opened a case of fraud against the mission. It has repeatedly stated that the mission &#8220;must close down,&#8221; but a court order preceding such a closure has not yet been obtained.Lowvelder asked where the mission acquires its funding.&#8220;We have spent thousands of rand on the mission ourselves,&#8221; said Shai. They also depend on donations. One donor representative, NG Kerk Fochville Noord&#8217;s Rev Johan Brink, said that their contributions would not depend on BBM being accredited by the state. &#8220;Jesus did not ask: &#8216;do you believe?&#8217; before offering his help to others,&#8221; he said. &#8220;BBM has always accounted to us when they received something, satisfactorily so,&#8221; he said.The mission denies issuing degrees to its students. Photo: Facebook.Rev Maarten van Helden, from the Gereformeerde Kerk in Centurion, said that BBM has been doing &#8220;wonderful work&#8221; for years. &#8220;I can confirm that what is taught there is of sound doctrine. The students come from all over Africa and are empowered to preach. Where else would they get the opportunity?&#8221; he asked.&#8220;Remember, independent churches do not need accreditation as a prerequisite for their existence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Subjecting the spreading of the gospel to the state&#8217;s or human standards, seeks to limit the working of the Holy Spirit. We cannot do that,&#8221; he said. According to local Gereformeerde Kerk minister, Rev Thys Erasmus, accountability must be sought from bible colleges. &#8220;When giving to a cause such as a bible college, you must ask where the money is going, who is keeping an eye on the course content and to what extent the qualifications issued benefit its holder,&#8221; he said.To Shai, BBM&#8217;s teaching Christianity throughout Africa remains a priority, regardless of the government&#8217;s stance.
