She said she was petrified because the sounds of the thunder and the lightning strikes were so loud.I thought lightning must have hit somewhere close by, but I never thought it would be next door. When I went to the front door to let my husband in, I saw what looked like flashlights in the two bedrooms of the Kinnear house. I thought someone was breaking in,&#8221; Odendaal said.&#8220;Then I noticed the sparks. I screamed that the house was on fire. I grabbed the hose and the fire extinguisher while Thinus informed the emergency WhatsApp group and called the fire brigade. Other residents also came to help. Everyone was there.&#8221;Thanks to those helpful neighbours, the Kinnears&#8217; main bedroom and the outer parameters of the single-storey house were saved.
