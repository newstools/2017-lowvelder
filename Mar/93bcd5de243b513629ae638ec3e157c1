MBOMBELA &#8211; Parliament said in a statement that &#8220;the gist of (the calls received by Dr Makhosi Khoza) hint at some unhappiness with the stern views her committee made during its oversight programme in the last two days&#8221;.Khoza is an ANC MP who chairs the parliamentary portfolio committee on public service and administration, monitoring and evaluation.This week the committee was particularly critical of the Department of Health.After a visit to Matikwane Hospital, it said it was &#8220;alarmed by the inexcusable service being rendered by healthcare officials&#8221;.The committee also noted that there was &#8220;paralysis&#8221; in the department. Following a briefing on the department&#8217;s administration, the committee slammed it for not complying with the Financial Disclosures Framework Act, failing to pay suppliers within 30 days and spending its budget to achieve half of its targets in 2015/16.Department spokesman, Mr Dumisani Malamule denied any crisis, saying they had improved and worked tirelessly to continue to do so.The ANC in Mpumalanga said it took the allegations extremely seriously. We urge her to report these allegations to authorities, because we don t read this as an attack to the persona of Dr Khoza, but also to the democracy of this country, spokesman Ms Sasekani Manzini said in a statement.
