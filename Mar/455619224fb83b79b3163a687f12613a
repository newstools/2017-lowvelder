 Were you part of the 1970s and what was it all about? Paul Feig, American director and actor, once said: “when I went to high school in the late 1970s, disco was in full swing and anyone who was into it dressed the part.  I know I did.” The songs of the 70s have a very specific sound and bring back special memories to those who experienced that decade.
