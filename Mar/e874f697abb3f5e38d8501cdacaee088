SKUKUZA &#8211; SANParks is in dispute with the operator of former Mugg &amp; Bean and Debonairs outlets at certain rest camps in the Kruger National Park (KNP).The operator, Famous Brands, said that they had terminated the franchise agreement between the group and the franchisee of these Mugg &amp; Bean and Debonairs outlets.According to SANParks acting head of communications, William Mabasa, following a host of complaints by guests on various social media platforms in relation to the quality of service experienced by guests at Mugg and Bean and Debonairs pizza restaurants at Letaba, Satara and Olifants camps in the KNP, a dispute has been declared.Restaurant operations at Mugg &amp; Bean Lower Sabie and Wimpy Pretoriuskop are unaffected as they are owned and managed by another franchisee.SANParks is currently embarking on an arbitration process with the operator in question and is unable to confirm how long the process will take. Arbitration proceedings are underway, said Mabasa. He said in an effort to address this challenge and improve service standards for the comfort of guests booked at the affected rest camps, SANParks will endeavour to put temporary substitutes in as operators of the restaurants particularly during peak times. SANParks management sincerely apologises for the inconvenience, concluded Mabasa.The Mugg and Bean operator, Famous Brands, has requested for their outlets to be debranded but food will be available at the outlets and the restaurants are operational although all the branded products might not be available.&#8220;Famous Brands has regretfully terminated the franchise agreement between the group and the franchisee of the Mugg &amp; Bean and Debonairs Pizza restaurants at the Letaba, Satara and Olifants camps in the KNP,&#8221; said Frederic Cornet, spokesperson for Famous Brands.&#8220;Despite interaction with the franchisee following a breach in terms of the said franchise agreements, the franchisee failed to remedy the situation notwithstanding having had opportunity to do so,&#8221; said Cornet.The franchise agreement stipulates that in the event of termination, all intellectual property belonging to Mugg &amp; Bean and Debonairs Pizza must be removed by the franchisee within ten days of termination of the agreement.&#8220;The de-branding process will commence shortly and the now ex-franchisee has indicated that the outlets will be run as independent operations that is non-franchised,&#8221; explained Cornet.Famous Brands would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced by patrons of these restaurants as a result of this action.&nbsp;
