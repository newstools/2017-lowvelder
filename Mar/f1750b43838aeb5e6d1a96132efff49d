Come move-in day, the usually docile family tabby turns into Beelzebub the second her paws meet the paving. The adored Jack Russell pulls a Wade van Niekerk into the undergrowth to chase a rabbit, yelps loudly, and is never seen again. The kids are distraught and start having nightmares &#8211; mom and dad put it down to the trauma of their beloved AWOL Fido and possessed kitty.Little Molly starts having conversations with some unsavoury imaginary friends, Norman the teenager gets obsessive about watching Bates Motel re-runs, mom thinks she is going off her rocker because none of her stuff is where she put it, and dad puts it all down to the stress of the move and that s about when all hell breaks loose. Sounds like a pretty predictable, low-grade horror movie script, right? Except that horror houses aren t always the stuff of movies, lore and legend.Buyer s remorse is real Real homeowners have moved into their new digs only to discover a veritable Pandora s Box of scary defects that weren t disclosed by the seller or agent, nor in plain sight when they viewed the property. From discovering a nest of hundreds of snakes living in the ceiling, to illegally built additions that collapsed the drainage system and flooded the garden with sewerage every six months, to defective leaking roofs concealed under false ceilings, termite-infested roof trusses, rising damp, to forged electrical compliance certificates &#8211; there s no end to the cases of unsuspecting buyers being lumbered with property duds that have cost them dearly in the pocket and the sanity department, explains Lee-Ann Dobrescu, Head of Group Business Development at Hollard and co-founder of Hollard s Home Warranty.Even if you re able to pursue the costly legal route and prove that the seller knew about the defects when they sold to you, you ll still be stuck with the hefty and unexpected costs to make the property liveable while you re in it, in addition to your legal fees. And as history proves, cases involving latent defects and alleged seller dishonesty in disclosing such defects can take years to reach conclusion. Not many people have the extra cash and time to throw around to pursue such a case and the seller may not have the cash to right the wrong anyway.LOOKING FOR A NEW HOME? VISIT LOWVELDER HOMES TODAY!
