MBOMBELA &#8211; Between last December and January the number of code B licensed drivers increased by more than 10 000, according to MyPressportal. Code B licences accommodate vehicles not exceeding 3 500 kilograms. Many people do not research the driving school or instructor beforehand, are unfamiliar with important driver s test rules and scoring, experience the test route for the first time when taking the test, or are simply too nervous on the day, says Derek Wilson, head of online insurance and financial services comparison website, Hippo.co.za, These and other factors could be demotivating and costly to drivers. Ensure you have a legitimate, ethical and experienced driving school and instructor, check reviews and ask around.Learn the immediate fail items, visit www.k53-test.co.za.Take as many lessons as you need, perfect every manoeuvre, and book your test when you have confidence.Keep practising until the test day arrives and ask your driving instructor to take you for a trial on the test route and in the test yard two or three days beforehand.Mentally reassure and remind yourself that you have done it all before and that you can do what is required. Try not to rush things and rather take your time to do it properly.Remember your training after you get your licence, and stay responsible and safe, or you might end up on Lowvelder&#8217;s #Straatvark feature.
