One does not always have your passions figured out, but for the legendary Duncan Faure, singing came naturally from a young age.&#8220;I always wanted to be a musician. I heard Jeremy Taylor&#8217;s &#8216;Ag pleez Deddy&#8217; when I was five. I sang and won a talent competition at the Durban Little Top with Dickie Loader &amp; The Blue Jeans. Then after The Beatles, the rest was history,&#8221; he stated.He even spends his free time writing new songs. &#8220;I have got so many new songs that are just waiting to go,&#8221; he confessed. He added that he will be visiting the Kruger National Park during his visit.Faure reported that being a musician has its ups and downs, and everything can either be the best or the worst.He laughed and said, &#8220;The best is when you make really good money, the worst part is when you make really bad money.&#8221;Despite the monetary value of being a musician, Faure still lives out his passions through his music. &#8220;It&#8217;s just something I have always done. I gather inspiration from love. Every time you fall in love you write songs,&#8221; he laughed.The star is able to work with youthful band members, and connects with younger audiences as well as the original following. &#8220;I think a lot of the young people sort of like us oldies, thank you very much!&#8221; he said.Robbie Rist is an American musician and actor. Faure plans to work with Rist in the near future to produce at least six new singles he has written.The musician has an impressive r sum of artist collaborations checked off the proverbial bucket list, but has two more names he would like to tick before the end of his career: &#8220;Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney!&#8221;He added that the two things he cannot live without are guitars and toothpaste.The absolute highlights of his career are Bay City Rollers, Rabbitt and being featured on Madonna&#8217;s &#8216;Who&#8217;s that girl&#8217; soundtrack.&#8220;A Swedish band called La Fleur Fatale recorded one of my songs that was played quite extensively called &#8216;How long is too long&#8217;. It is one of my best songs. Recording with Billy Joel&#8217;s drummer, Liberty DeVitto, was also certainly a highlight. I have also enjoyed working with Kofi Baker, son of Ginger Baker.&#8221;
