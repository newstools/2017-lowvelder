MBOMBELA &#8211; Nine-year-old Vuyo Nkosi had the time of his life on Friday, when his dreams to fly in a helicopter and ride on a motorcycle became a reality.The boy was surprised when he realised he was going to fly in a chopper during his discharge party from Mediclinic Nelspruit, where he spent the past two months receiving treatment for cancer. Vuyo spent four weeks in ICU following the removal of a brain tumour.He also received physiotherapy from Stepmed. On Friday the shy and ecstatic Vuyo jumped with excitement.Ms Nerine Wasserfall from Stepmed said during their conversations with him, they realised that he is adventurous. They then arranged a chopper flip for him.&#8220;He told us that he would love to board a plane or ride on a motorbike. We organised the party and the helicopter trip because we wanted to do something special for him. During the time we spent with him we grew great love for him,&#8221; said Wasserfall.According to Wasserfall, it would not have been possible to arrange the flight without those who had volunteered to help.The helicopter ride was sponsored by local pilot and businessman, Mr Victor Picoto. Mr Trevor Wilson from Kishugu arranged the helicopter. ER 24&#8217;s Mr Greg Wilcox arranged and sponsored the in-flight paramedic, Ms Kim Habib, who flew alongside Vuyo to ensure his safety.&#8220;We thank all the people who made this a reality.Ms Robyn Baard from the hospital arranged helipad clearance and medical clearances for Vuyo. Without the volunteers all of these would not have been possible,&#8221; said Wasserfall.Mr Mohammed Essa, from Rudamans Bike and Marine Nelspruit, sponsored the motorcycle trip around the hospital.She said they were excited to have touched his life. &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to treat the body, but to impact the life of a patient is more fulfilling.&#8221;Vuyo&#8217;s aunt, Ms Zanele Nhlapo, said the family was grateful to Stepmed and Mediclinic for the love they showed Vuyo.&#8220;Normally when we send our loved ones to hospitals we do not expect the doctors to go beyond the call of duty and when they do we need to appreciate them,&#8221; she said.
