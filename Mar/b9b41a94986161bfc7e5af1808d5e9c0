UPDATE 15:49:SKUKUZA &#8211; The low-water bridge at Lower Sabie is now open. It now serves as the only link between all areas between the south and the north of the Sabie River.Adding to this news Mr William Mabasa, acting head of communication at SANParks, also said that the H1/2-road between Tshokwane and Skukuza remains closed due to flood damage of a bridge some five kilometres north of the Sabie River high water bridge.&#8220;Please note that this part of the road will remain closed for at least two weeks whilst a detour is created,&#8221; said Mabasa.The bridge on the road between Skukuza and Tshokwane was swept away.This serious damage to the road and bridge was caused by lots of water coming down from the Mantimahle Dam (this dam runs into the N&#8217;watindlopfu stream that crosses the S30 just north of the Sabie River) which burst Saturday night.SKUKUZA &#8211; The H1/2-road between Skukuza and Tshokwane in the Kruger National Park (KNP) has a damaged bridge and is therefore not accessible Mr William Mabasa, acting head of communications of SANParks, said to Lowvelder this morning.Access to the north and south between Skukuza and Tshokwane will only be via Lower Sabie low water bridge which is under water because of last night&#8217;s rainfall.&#8220;We hope it will subside during the day but everywhere else everything is fine and it is business as usual.Visitors who will be traveling between Satara and Skukuza or Skukuza to Satara must first check the water situation at Lower Sabie low water bridge at the reception offices before traveling. We will keep all informed of the developments.&#8221;
