MBOMBELA &#8211; The premier, Mr David Mabuza, said the provincial government is looking into possibly investing in Vantage Goldfields.He told the media on Monday, following his State of the Province Address, that they were contemplating intervening after the temporary closure of Lily Mine.&#8220;We are thinking that if there&#8217;s no investor, we can invest in the mine. What&#8217;s so unique about investments that we can&#8217;t do it ourselves? We cannot wait for outsiders to do that,&#8221; Mabuza said.Also read: &#8216;Hope is the only thing we are left with&#8217;The Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency was due to meet with Vantage Goldfields, which was placed under business rescue yesterday.Mabuza claimed they would aim to empower locals. &#8220;What is unique about us is that we won&#8217;t be doing it for profit. We can reinvest the money over and over, and develop our people,&#8221; he said.The unavailability of investors has severely affected the local community through job losses after it collapsed on February 5 last year.Mabuza added that the provincial government has resolved that the Department of Social Development would &#8220;adopt&#8221; the families of the three miners, Ms Pretty Nkambule, Ms Yvonne Mnisi and Mr Solomon Nyirenda, whose bodies have been trapped underground ever since.Also read: Meeting to resolve Lily Mine issues underway &#8220;We visited Low&#8217;s Creek and realised that poverty is rife in the area. There are no economic activities. People are only working on farms and in mines. There is fertile land that the community can utilise for agriculture,&#8221; he said.Mr Rob Devereaux from Sturns, the business-rescue practitioner for Lily and Barbrook mines, said they were willing to enter into an agreement with government to save jobs.Accountant Mr Henri Pieters from Stabilis, pointed out that a huge capital injection was required to start up the mine.&#8220;The idea to reinvest profits is great, but the question is how much will it cost to become profitable and how long will it take,&#8221; said Pieters.He added that government does not have the expertise or skills to mine.&#8220;The only possible alternative to get involved is through a public-private partnership, but that should also only happen after a proper due diligence has been performed on the mine,&#8221; he concluded.
