MBOMBELA &#8211; ANC provincial chairman, Mr David Mabuza said he was not impressed with Free State chairman, Mr Ace Magashule who was urging the party&#8217;s members to support Mabuza to become deputy president.Magashule told mourners at Mabuza&#8217;s late brother&#8217;s funeral over the weekend. &#8220;I want to say to members of the ANC in Mpumalanga, don&#8217;t stop. If you want Mabuza as deputy president, elect him.&#8221;He said it wasn&#8217;t Mabuza&#8217;s place to decide whether he wanted to be deployed or not, but the decision of the party and its branches. The party will elect new leadership in December.Mabuza told the media and members of his executive council during a post-Sopa briefing last week that Magashule&#8217;s comments contravened organisational rules, to abstain from announcing leaders before the nomination process was opened.Both Mabuza and Magashule, along with North West premier, Mr Supra Mahumapelo are believed to be the &#8220;premier league&#8221; aligned to the president, Mr Jacob Zuma. Mabuza said he was unhappy with Magashule&#8217;s comments.&#8220;All I can tell people is not to break the rules of the ANC in my name. I know it&#8217;s fashionable, people want to talk about me. If you are not clever enough you can think it&#8217;s a good thing. There might be people with good intentions, but there are also those with bad ones. It&#8217;s two-fold, like a wrapped sweet that looks good inside it might not be right inside,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The premier came to the province to support me when I was burying my brother. ANC supporters were there too. I told him to greet those people as a chairman in the Free State. When he gets there he told them to back me.&#8221;Mabuza said he later told Magashule that what he did was wrong because leaders should respect the rules.&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to catch this carrot that is being dangled. What I saw here in the province is enough, I don&#8217;t want another carrot. I am saying let us not discuss this matter. When we meet let us discuss the policy conference and how we can help the youth and deal with unemployment.&#8221;Mabuza would not be drawn in on questions about a possible position in the top six of the party&#8217;s national executive committee.&#8220;I can&#8217;t enter into that discussion until the right moment. So you are allowed to gossip. I understand that you are concerned about where we are headed. But for now I can say no, as the ANC we say let&#8217;s not discuss positions and what we want to do in the elective conference,&#8221; he said.
