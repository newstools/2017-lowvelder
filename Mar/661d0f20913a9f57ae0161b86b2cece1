MBOMBELA &#8211; The DA has presented its plan to rescue the province from &#8220;a slippery slope&#8221;, but the plan fails to clearly outline practical solutions to most of the issues they continually raise as the official opposition.Also read: DA fed up with poor service delivery Although the party&#8217;s blueprint for economic growth, improving the status of education and fast-tracking land redistribution seems to be a good model, it does not provide a concrete outline as to how it will be implemented.The party presented its plan to the press on Tuesday. When asked how it would fight crime if it won a majority in the next general elections, provincial leader, Mr James Masango, said a national plan was in place to combat crime.&#8220;Nationally, we have a plan for crime. Unlawful acts in most cases is the responsibility of national government, police falls under the national commissioner,&#8221; he said.He did not explain their provincial strategy. Following an attack on a home for the disabled in Balfour this week, the party said.&#8220;The desperate need for rural safety units has once again been highlighted by yet another brutal attack on vulnerable members of our society. The DA will continue to fight for the safety and protection of rural communities.&#8221; Also read: Former DA leader says goodbye to politics &#8211; againHowever, the rescue plan makes no mention of such units. The detailed strategy also does not show how the party will address inadequate housing in rural areas.Masango said the DA hoped to grow the economy. &#8220;A lot of people turn to crime because they don&#8217;t get employment. If you grow the economy and create jobs, people will shy away from crime,&#8221; he said.By growing the economy, Mr Bosman Grobler, said they would disband the Mpumalanga Economic Growth Agency and replace it with a structured partnership between government and the private sector.&#8220;Organised business structures will become key in driving economic growth and job creation in our province,&#8221; GroblerThe DA proposed dissolving parastatals such as the Mpumalanga Regional Training Trust, and replacing it with tertiary schools for artisans. Grobler added that the land issue needed urgent attention.&#8220;Without an audit of who owns the land, we cannot start to address the issue. Some of the government leaders are those who own the land. We need to be realistic,&#8221; he said.&nbsp;Party chairman, Ms Jane Sithole, said the DA will prioritise improving early childhood development (ECD) centres to create systematic academic&#8220;If you look closely, you will see that teachers at these centres are paid less. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t motivate them. We believe they should be paid better to give them motivation,&#8221; she said.Sithole said they would open training colleges to ensure a supply of qualified teachers from ECD until senior level.
