 MBOMBELA – Atile Active Children’s Foundation (AACF) in association with Be Disciplined and Dedicated (BDD), Sunbake RCL Foods and Mathata Group hosted a fun day for underprivileged children living in Mataffin on Saturday.  The children participated in a number of obstacle courses. One of these was supervised by rugby player, Hilton Lobberts. He said he liked participating in the event. “Sport has given me so much in my life. Consequently, I wish to pass this passion on to these children by showing them how fun living an active lifestyle can be.” Mathata Group chairman, Cedric Mashile. told Lowvelder that the organisation provides assistance to impoverished children in the area in a number of ways. “We always support the kids, especially through sport. We sponsor soccer and netball tournaments. We also select two learners who are doing well at school and pay for their education every year.”  The day ended with the children, tired from having fun the entire day, receiving hot cross buns and juice.
