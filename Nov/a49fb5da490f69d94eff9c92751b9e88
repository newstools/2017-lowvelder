 MBOMBELA – Sanral has announced that it plans to take over fewer kilometres of the country’s roads than originally planned due to “financial and human capital” limits.

This is due to the fact that the agency does not possess the financial and human capital capacity to take command of such a large network of roads. It aims to prevent a situation in which road transfers were done without the needed budget transfers from the appropriate road authorities. “To date, budget allocations from National Treasury have not sufficiently covered the life-cycle cost requirements of the transferred roads”, explained the agency’s stakeholder manager, Michael Siphiwo Mxhosa. Not adopting the strategy could “seriously endanger” the agency’s ability to maintain the roads from a life-cycle-cost perspective.

The absence of private finance will reduce the funding envelope for national roads in the medium to long term and result in project delays or cancellations.” Mothusi Phoku and Kgaugelo Segage. During the meeting it further announced that its transformation policy required that Sanral ensures that organisations which receive comprehensive toll-road operations and maintenance tenders specify a minimum of 51 per cent black ownership.
