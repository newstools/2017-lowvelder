 MBOMBELA – Areas of Barberton and Mbombela were hit by heavy storms on Wednesday. Over 24 hours the South African Weather Service recorded 81 millimetres of rain in the Barberton area and 44 millimetres in Mbombela.  Mbombelan, André Nel’s house was extensively damaged and his dog was killed during the storm. The dog was electrocuted by a cable dislodged from the roof.  Describing the extent of the damage, Nel said, “More than half the house was destroyed. At the time of taking out insurance I did not realise that I had to specify certain items. Consequently the insurance is refusing to pay to replace them.” At Pro Gratia Learning Centre two classrooms were damaged. Marketing manager of the school, Yulandi Jansma said, “The one classroom was completely destroyed. The ferocity of the storm removed the roof. This caused the entire structure to collapse. The other classroom was so damaged that it has been deemed unfit for learning.”  The school urgently needs assistance from members of the public to rebuild the two classrooms and replace damaged therapy equipment. Those looking to offer their assistance can contact the principal of Pro Gratia, Andri Bester on 072-376-5680. Alternatively they can contact finance director, Welma Bezuidenhout on 061-481-5532.
