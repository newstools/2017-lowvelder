 MBOMBELA – On Friday the MEC for education, Ms Reginah Mhaule, will launch the 2018 election of School Governing Bodies (SGB) in the province. The event will be held at Church on the Hill from 13:00. Mr Jasper Zwane, spokesperson for the department, explained that the term of office for the current SGB members will end in March 2018. In a government notice (No. 376) he affirmed that the period for next year’s SGB elections is from March 1 to 31.  “To this end, the MEC will use the occasion to extend her profound appreciation to all members of the school governing bodies who diligently served during the current term and further request them to begin a process in preparation for the handover of reports,” he said. SGBs are statutory bodies, according to South African Schools Act, that stand in a position of trust on behalf of the school. The election of a SGB, therefore, constitutes one of the most important activities that the Department of Education engages in.  “I, therefore, request all those who are eligible to volunteer to be elected as well as professionals to be available to be co-opted to the school governing bodies. In doing so, we will ensure that our schools are governed in an efficient manner that promotes the interest of learners at all times. Every effort will be made by the department working with the Associations of School Governing Bodies to create a favourable environment for the newly elected members to render their functions. Let’s make our schools work for our communities,” Mhaule concluded.
