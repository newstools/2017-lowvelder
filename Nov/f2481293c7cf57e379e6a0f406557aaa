 BUSHBUCKRIDGE – The matric learners of Moses Mnisi High School know hard work. In their quest to obtain the best possible marks in the National Senior Certificate exams, all 150 matriculants are camping out at the modest, rural school. The pupils of the school, in the little-known village of Okkerneutboom, have been putting in the extra hours to ensure that they maintain the school’s 12-year, 100-per- cent pass rate. They practically study around the clock and sleep wherever they can, including in the school hall and classrooms. Lacking basic amenities and supplies, they make do with little in the form of food and comfort.  The matriculants camped out at the rural school to study around the clock.
