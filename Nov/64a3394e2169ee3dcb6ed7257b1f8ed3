 MBOMBELA – After a barrage of complaints about the municipality’s traffic officers and officials, City of Mbombela Local Municipality is doing something
about it. According to spokesman David Shabangu, they are in the process of consolidating all the complaints. “We will have a session with all traffic employees on the matter and how they should carry themselves,” he stated. Since a letter was published complaining about the conduct of Mbombela traffic officials, Lowvelder received three more complaints which were brought to the municipality’s attention. Shabangu said they received many more thereafter.  Jennifer Sterne’s nephew, who was in the country from Australia on honeymoon with his new bride, was stopped outside Hazyview for allegedly failing to come to a halt at a stop sign. They were charged
R2 000 which was later reduced to R1 000 for which they never got a ticket nor a receipt. A man from White River claimed officials at the department were rude to him when going for an eye test. “My ID book was thrown at me and fell on the floor,” he said. He was shocked and angry but did not react, fearing an unpleasant outcome. “This seems to be the case in all government offices with their disgraceful, shameful behaviour and attitude,” he stated.
Another resident had gone to renew his/her licence at the Mbombela traffic department where they were told they do not take ID photographs inside.  “The official sent me and the guy behind me to a shabby office where we both had to pay R46 for four poor-quality pictures.”When they eventually returned from having their eyes tested, they were told that they did not need the photos, as they were taken internally. “This place needs a serious shake-up.”
