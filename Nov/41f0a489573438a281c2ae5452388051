 As South Africa is battered by droughts on the one side and floods on the other, we are constantly reminded of the urgency of dealing with climate change, said Jaco du Toit of WWF South Africa at the recent COP23 negotiations in Bonn. South Africa and the Africa Group championed the urgency of more climate change action and financial support for vulnerable developing countries. “As our negotiating team returns home we hope to see the same resolve to act ambitiously on climate change in our own national policies,” Du Toit said. As the UN climate talks ended, WWF recognised the progress made with the groundwork for increasing climate ambition up to 2020 and beyond, but noted that 2018 will be key for countries to clearly signal their intention to enhance their climate plans. Negotiators have gathered in Bonn under a Fiji presidency and, as states deliberate on future action, cities, regions, businesses and communities have stepped up their efforts to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. COP23 has provided important building blocks to move the spirit of the Paris Agreement forward, but success is far from guaranteed. Du Toit said countries around the world were entrusted with an important mandate in Paris and are making progress, but with the impacts of climate change accelerating, the pace and scale of the response is still insufficient. “It is time to show bolder vision, innovation, and urgent action – domestically and on the international front – and build on the clear momentum we are seeing in our societies and economies already. The 24th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP24) to the UNFCCC will take place from 3-14 December 2018 in Katowice, Poland.
