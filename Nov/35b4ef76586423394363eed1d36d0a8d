 MBOMBELA – The Public Service Commission presented its first report for the 20172018 financial year at the Mpumalanga Legislature on Thursday. The commission presented cases under investigation, including public administration investigation, labour relations improvement, national anti-corruption and matters pertaining to senior managers in the public service. According to the commission, the amount of money involved in financial misconduct in the 2016/ 2017 financial year was over R16 million. A total of R8 million was recovered after last year’s Status of Financial Misconduct in Mpumalanga report. An amount of over R7 million was not recovered despite the report. The commission has since had meetings with the affected departments.  It announced that the Department of Human Settlement has started instituting criminal cases and civil recoveries against individuals implicated in financial misconduct. Cases under public administration investigations include that of a patient’s death at Themba Hospital in December last year. According to the commission, the matter has been finalised and has been referred to the Chief State Law Advisor at the Department of Justice for a legal opinion. Other cases relate to abuse of government resources, service delivery issues at clinics and assistance provided to members of the public in respect of obtaining their work permits and pension benefits. The province has achieved a 99 per cent compliance rate in terms of the Financial Disclosure Framework. The PSC is the custodian of the National Anti-Corruption Hotline (NACH) which was previously administered by Deloitte in Umhlanga. The commission took it over in January this year.
