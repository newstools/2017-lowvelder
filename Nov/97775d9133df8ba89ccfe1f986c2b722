 MBOMBELA – Former police officer and J&M Security’s investigations manager, Ockie Brits (52) died after colliding with a vehicle on the N2 in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. Brits, an avid biker, was returning from a rally in Pinetown at the time of the accident.  According to Johnnie Terblanche, J&M Security’s owner, it is believed that the driver had been making a U-turn on the national road outside Richard’s Bay.  “Two of his fellow riders managed to swerve out of the way of the vehicle on time,” he explained. Brits, unfortunately, could not and collided with it. Brits worked for the SAPS for 25 years. He was one of the officers involved in the arrest of known cash-in-transit robber, Collen Chauke.  He joined J&M Security 11 years ago where he worked as a guarding and investigations manager in White River.  “He was very professional and loved everyone including his family,” said Terblanche. He is survived by his wife, Nicolette, and two children Tharina and Ettiene.
