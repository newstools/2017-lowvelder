SKUKUZA – Rangers were on high alert on Sunday morning when they heard shots fired near Nwaswitshakaspruit in the Skukuza region where they later came across a rhino carcass. After following tracks for a few kilometres, they came across three poachers who had just shot another two rhinos, one of which had had its horn already removed.  They subsequently arrested the poachers and found them to be in possession of two horns. A forensic team did an autopsy on two of the carcasses yesterday, and processed the remaining one today. The men appeared in court this morning.
