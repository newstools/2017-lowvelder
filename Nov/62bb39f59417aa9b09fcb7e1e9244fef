 MBOMBELA – One of the two suspects wanted for the rape of children at Mama Esther’s Safe Haven was apprehended in Pilgrim’s Rest on Wednesday. Police spokesman, Sgt Gerald Sedibe could not confirm details surrounding the arrest as he was still being fetched to be brought back to Mbombela.  The suspect was identified by an eight-year-old boy who was raped by a 27-year-old man at the orphanage. When asked how he was raped, he replied that it was the same way the suspect had always done it. This led to the revelation that a further seven children and a 20-year-old man had fallen victim to the white man who occasionally stayed at the orphanage.  The 27-year-old man used to play soccer with the children and also stayed at the orphanage occasionally. The story is developing.
