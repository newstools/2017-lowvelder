 MBOMBELA – An enormous 13-metre high, seven-metre wide, custom-made Christmas tree will light up Mbombela’s skyline this festive season. This home-grown initiative, designed in South Africa and assembled by a team from Durban, makes use of locally produced components and lights and will be on display at The Grove shopping centre from December 1. Installation of the structure is due to start today and the lights will be switched on from Friday.

According to Mike Prentice, SPAR Group marketing director, “We wanted the tree to be 100 per cent made in South Africa and lit by a multitude of LED lights – all locally designed and manufactured. We want to revisit the nostalgia of Christmas and create a beautiful and iconic statement in a public place which can be enjoyed by both residents and visitors.” Also read: Christmas carols at Penryn chapel gets public into the spirit of Christmas
