 MBOMBELA – Despite moving out of their house and selling some of their furniture, Verna and Ryno Mulder are not leaving town.
The parents of baby Mienkie, who has touched the hearts of a great many people across the country with her tale of recovery after suffering brain damage, are temporarily moving closer to their little one. “We just decided to move some of our stuff back to our old house,” explained Ryno. Since Mienke’s hospitalisation, the family has been at the mercy of relatives, friends and a lodge in Johannesburg where they come together on weekends.  “It just made it difficult when having family time and you are living in someone’s house or the girls want to ride their bikes outside of a lodge where they would be disturbing other guests,” he added.
For convenience’s sake Ryno and Verna decided to move out of their home in Mbombela and back into their old home in Benoni in Johannesburg’s East Rand.  Over the past weeks, Ryno has put some of the family’s furniture up for sale on Facebook. The reason for this, he explained, is because they already have some of the items in Benoni. As a result, Ryno, who continues to stay and work in town, is homeless.

Mienke is doing much better. Her parents were able to take her home for the weekend two weeks ago, much to the excitement of her sisters, Leané and Zamoné.  “Leané couldn’t stop talking about it afterwards,” said Verna.
The weekend visit was not without its challenges as she had to be monitored around the clock and fed through a tube in her stomach which is quite a lengthy process. “But we are used to it because we feed her at the hospital, so it was fine,” she added.

MRI scans revealed that she suffered severe brain damage. She has been undergoing rehabilitation for almost a month. An eye specialist confirmed that she can see. Her brain, however, cannot recognise what she sees. Her eyes will be reassessed to see whether there has been any improvement.  She is also feeding through her mouth which is part of her treatment to help her eat normally again.
On Monday the nine-month-old underwent another operation to change the feeding peg in her stomach. According to Ryno, the operation was to allow the peg to be closed when she is not feeding.
