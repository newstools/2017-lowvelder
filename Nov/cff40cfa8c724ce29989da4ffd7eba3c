 WHITE RIVER – “It has not sunk in yet,” said a stoic Nicolette Brits. Her husband’s loss is the second greatest blow – the first is losing both of her sons in 2010 and 2013. “What can we do? We must do it and move on,” she said. Nicolette has returned from Richards Bay where her husband, Ockert “Ockie” Brits died after his bike collided with a vehicle making a U-turn on the John Ross Highway between Empangeni and Richards Bay on Sunday. Ockie was returning from the Chicken Rally in Pinetown in KwaZulu-Natal. He and some of his riding companions broke away from the group they had been travelling with. According to Shaun Terblanche of J&M Security, the road conditions en route to the rally were bad.  “They opted to use the highway as the road conditions there were better,” he said. Ockie had been riding behind two other bikers who were able to swerve out of the vehicle’s way on time. He was not so lucky, and the vehicle collided with him head-on. The driver of the vehicle allegedly fled the scene, leaving his white Mercedes-Benz behind. He has, however, been traced and called in to give a statement to Empangeni SAPS. Police spokesman, Capt Mbongeni Mdlalose, confirmed that the driver has come forward. “Once all the evidence has been compiled, the docket will be sent to the NPA, which will decide whether he will be charged or not,” Mdlalose said. Until then, funeral arrangements continue back home. Ockie’s memorial will be on Wednesday, November 15 at Manna Christian Fellowship in White River at 11:00.  Ockie started working as a police officer in Johannesburg’s East Rand in 1985. In 1992 he moved to Mbombela where he worked in the murder-and-robbery unit until 1999. He later moved to the violent-and-serious-crimes unit where he worked until his retirement in 2008. He went into private security where he first worked for Hi-Tech Guards before joining J&M Security. He is survived by his wife of 32 years and two children, Tharina and Ettienne.
