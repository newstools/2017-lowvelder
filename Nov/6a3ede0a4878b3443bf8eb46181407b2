 So you know about your liver and binge drinking, but what about your pancreas? With the festive season upon us, the obligatory round of Christmas parties in full flow, and the calendar full of social occasions, it’s tempting for people to overindulge and drink more than they would at other times of the year. A specialist physician at Spire Leeds Hospital is warning of the damage to health caused by excessive alcohol consumption. Christian Macutkiewicz, consultant in pancreatico-biliary and laparoscopic surgery at Spire Leeds Hospital says, “Most people are aware of the link between alcohol and liver damage, but it’s not as well known that alcohol can also severely damage the pancreas and lead to acute pancreatitis”.  “Unlike the liver, the pancreas cannot regenerate itself. Repeated attacks of pancreatitis can lead to diabetes and in severe pancreatitis, can damage other organs and become life threatening. “Nobody wants to be a killjoy during the festive season, however it’s very important to drink in moderation. People need to be able to make informed decisions about their own drinking. It helps to be aware of how much alcohol you are consuming and how quickly.” Macutkiewicz said binge drinking as well as long-term alcohol use could cause inflammation of the pancreas called pancreatitis (acute or chronic), a serious and painful condition.   A person with mild acute pancreatitis will probably be admitted to a general hospital ward and treated with pain management, oxygen and IV fluids through a drip. Patients usually need a few days for the inflammation to settle, to be able to control the pain and for proper food intake to resume.  Men and women should not exceed 14 units of alcohol per week. Macutkiewicz advises to spread those units over three or more days and not to store them up for a binge session over one or two days. “A good way to reduce alcohol intake is to have several alcohol-free days a week.”
