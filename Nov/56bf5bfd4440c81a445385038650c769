Programme The event will kick off at 18:00. We will follow a similar programme to 2016, but with additional activities, broader participation of local organisations, partial street closure and catering for more people.  Activities We hope to have parades of people, bicycles, or motor bikes all dressed up in lights Involvement How can you get involved? We are ALL White River and this is our party!
