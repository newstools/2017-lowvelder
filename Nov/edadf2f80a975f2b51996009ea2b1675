MBOMBELA – Lowvelder received several calls from owners and tenants of business premises along the stream flowing below Old Pretoria Road between the R40 and Silva Street, who complained about the stench and sewage visibly pouring into the stream from a pipe next to the bridge.
On occasions the influx was so strong that it hampered business at adjacent premises, while at times it stopped long enough to only leave traces of murky water in the perennial stream.
“We try our best to keep this little stretch of waterfront clean and respectable,” the management at Battery Centre said.
“But it doesn’t help if the quality of the water itself is not playing along.”
A spokesman for Sembcorp Silulumanzi, Willus Khumalo confirmed that a sewage pump next to the parking area at BUCO had been out of order for a while, but that it had been fixed again last week.
“We followed up with complainants today and everybody confirmed that the smell was gone now,” he said on Wednesday.
