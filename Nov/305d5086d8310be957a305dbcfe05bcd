 MARITI – Strange circumstances surround the discovery of a body next to the R40 on Friday.
All evidence suggests that the victim, a female whose identity is unknown, was kidnapped and her hands tied, after which she was thrown into a body of water on the farm Watervalplaas. 
Capt Phillip Fakude, spokesman for Calutta Police Station, confirmed that the woman had been abducted in Masoyi about a week ago. A young cattle herder discovered her body on Friday and notified the police.
“Cases of murder and abduction are being investigated, but no arrests have been made yet,” he said.
Heavy rain prevented the SAPS Diving Unit from recovering the body on Friday, but it was able to do so in the early hours of Saturday when the rain cleared up. Fakude added that the unit found her with her hands and feet tied with binding wire. “Her mouth had also been sealed with adhesive tape,” he said.
