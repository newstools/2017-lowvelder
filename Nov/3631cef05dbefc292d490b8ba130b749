 It must be the epitome of powerlessness. For years, you have nurtured your child. You taught him everything he needed to know and you prayed that it would guide him in his decision making. You held her close and kept her safe. And now your teenager is in love. Oh dear. What if he breaks her heart? What if she ruins his year? What if they do the nasty? “I’m not ready to be a grandparent!” you boldly declare to nobody in particular. What are your options? None of the above. Although the thought of your child’s heart belonging to some teenager may scare you to death, you are going to have to deal with it. Sexologist Timothy Kieswetter gives guidance on how to do so.    On November 18, he will perform Die Stripshow – an entertaining, informative talk – at Emnotweni.
