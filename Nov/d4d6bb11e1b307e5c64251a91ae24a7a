 MONTROSE – Misty and wet conditions are believed to have contributed to a pedestrian’s death on the N4 this morning. According to Solange Soares Nicholson, spokesman for Trans African Concessions (TRAC), the pedestrian was hit and killed by a vehicle between Montrose and the Schoemanskloof intersection – a stretch of road that is currently under construction. She added that it occurred at around 05:30 this morning, when rain and fog resulted in poor visibility. “He had been walking on a stretch of road that only had one lane open to traffic due to said construction. He apparently stumbled and walked right in front of the vehicle traveling in Mbombela’s direction,” said Soares. The identity of the victim is unknown at this stage. The eastbound lane was closed but after the scene was cleared, was reopened. Soares urged motorists to practice extreme caution in these conditions and urged pedestrians to refrain from walking on the N4, even in normal conditions.
