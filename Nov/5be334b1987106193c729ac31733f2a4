 As a parent at one of our historic primary schools, Laerskool Nelspruit, I am qualified to say that the parking situation at the school has improved dramatically since the recent changes to the flow of traffic and allocation of staff parking. However, so many of the parents refuse to follow the rules which the principal has tried in vain to enforce many, many times. Even threats of fines from the traffic department do not deter some parents. People, park in marked parking bays. Donâ€™t park anywhere that is not a marked parking bay. Do not use the left-hand entry lane as a drop-off zone. Do not park in the road blocking the traffic. Remember, you are not more important or in more of a hurry than anyone else. A certain lawyer and a dentist in particular, refuse to park, and rather insist on stopping in the road while 20 cars back up behind them. Also, the road at the top of the island parking is not for parking. If you park there, no one can get to where they need to go. It is time to be respectful and considerate of others, and to remember that we can all see you.
