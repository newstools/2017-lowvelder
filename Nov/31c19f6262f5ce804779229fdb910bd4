MBOMBELA – Motorists should adhere to hippo warning signs, especially at night, warns the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA).
They should also keep within speed limits and be extra alert on roads known to be used by roaming hippos at night.
Hippos are often spotted at night in the vicinity of rivers or dams in the Lowveld, as has been the case on the R104 between Valencia and KamMagugu recently.
Several serious accidents involving hippos had been reported in the region over the years.
Spokesman for the MTPA, Kholofelo Nkambule, advises motorists seeing hippos grazing along the roadside to contact 10111, which will then contact the relevant officials.
“We don’t have a dedicated 24-hour number or a call centre within MTPA at this stage, but our officials work closely with the SAPS in most of these cases,” she commented on remarks by a social-media user who speculated about the fate of the roaming animals.
According to www.wildlifeafrica.co.za and similar websites, these are aggressive animals with the oldest and strongest males being most dominant. They are unpredictable and if encountered away from the safety of water, anything that gets between them and their refuge may be bitten or trampled.
During the day they stay in their pools or on sand banks, but at night they leave the water and look for feeding grounds, normally using the same route.
They are good climbers and often traverse rather steep banks at the night to graze on grass. They exit and enter the water at the same spots and graze for four to five hours each night in loop patterns, covering several square kilometres, with extended forays in search of food. Hippos can weigh up to
1 500 kilograms and their lifespan is about 50 years.
