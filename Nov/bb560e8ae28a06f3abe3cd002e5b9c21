 MBOMBELA – Hundreds of locals ushered in the weekend by enjoying the night out at the Open-Air Cinema at Mbombela Stadium on Friday. The romantic movie, The Notebook was screened.  Old and young, lovers, friends and family brought their picnic baskets for the Friday night treat.  Organiser, Jason McArthur from Lowveld Outdoor Events said he wanted to bring the open-air cinema scene with him when he moved to the Lowveld from Cape Town. “We had over 800 people express interest the last time (in Hazyview) and 5 000 from Mbombela also showed interest, so we decided to bring it closer to home,” he said. McArthur plans to make open-air events a Lowveld staple, and is open for suggestions from people about what they want to do or see. On November, 17, it is the kids’ turn. They will be showing the Pixar movie, Finding Nemo. They also plan to host markets and concerts, catering for people of all tastes.
