 KANYAMAZANE – More than 2 000 children at Lekazi and Shishila primary schools now have access to improved water and sanitation infrastructure, thanks to a partnership between Kimberly-Clark South Africa, Unicef and the Mpumalanga Department of Education. The initiative started as a pilot programme, part of the Kimberly-Clark Toilets Change Lives (TCL) campaign. It aimed to assist with the sanitation and hygiene conditions across the country, including handwashing stations being built in schools. Handwashing with soap is one of the most cost-effective interventions to prevent diarrhoea-related illness and deaths. By ensuring handwashing at critical times, up to 40 per cent of diarrhoea-related deaths, up to 47 per cent of all childhood diarrhoea cases and up to 25 per cent of respiratory infections can be prevented. “Unfortunately there are a number of South African schools with poor water and sanitation facilities,” explained Kimberly-Clark marketing director, John Clark.   With funding raised by Kimberly-Clark through the sale of Baby Soft White 9’s in SPAR, and implemented by Unicef, water stations were constructed and soap, toothpaste and toothbrushes provided, in partnership with the Mpumalanga Department of Education and the non-governmental organisation MiET Africa.

Unicef’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme is being rolled out in 292 primary schools in Mpumalanga, reaching almost 100 000 grade R, one and two learners. Handwashing stations will be built in an additional 42 schools in the province. Also see: WATCH: Construction site camp on Bester Street poses threat to motorists and pedestrians
