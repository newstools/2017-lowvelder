 Anisca is a dedicated rider and this paid off when she won the coveted Betty Burgess trophy at the recently held Mataffin Riding Club show. By winning this trophy, she proved that she is an all-rounder. She even beat accomplished adult riders who had many more years of experience. The runner-up was another junior rider, Savannah Combrinck.  The event kicked off with the showing disciplines on Saturday. First in were the little up-and-coming riders on their shining ponies. With little legs kicking furiously to get their steeds going, they trotted proudly around the arena. Savanna Combrinck. In the novice show pony class it was Zane Flemix, riding Penny Black, who took the first position, closely followed by Mia Tinkhoff on Penny White. Zane and Penny Black went on to win the show riding and working riding classes as well as the show hunter class, making a clean sweep for the day. In the junior division it was Savannah riding Dunhill who won the novice show hack class. The combination also took full honours in the show riding class. Zane Flemix. Shari Moore riding her young warmblood mare, Fircroft Vanquish, claimed the adult show hack class. Although Squishy, as the mare is affectionately known, is still young, she shows much quality and potential for the future and has been brilliantly started by Shari. Sunday morning started off with the poles on the ground class for both beginner riders and horses. The aim of this class was to get novice riders or horses used to a show without the pressure of big jumps.  The next few classes went progressively higher and ended with the 1,1-metre championship class. Photos: www.denfordstudios.co.za
