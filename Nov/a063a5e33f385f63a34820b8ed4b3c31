 MSHOLOZI – The Department of Social Development (DSD) this week finally started to remove children from Mama Esther’s Safe Haven.  Department spokesman, Ronnie Masilela confirmed to Lowvelder that they started removing some of the children on Monday. “We got a legal opinion from the state attorney that, based on the Children’s Act, we can remove the children.”
Eight children and a young woman were raped at the centre by two men known to them.  One, a 65-year-old, was arrested in connection with these cases in Pilgrim’s Rest. He is due back in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court for his bail application on November 13. Lowvelder has in the past reported about the DSD’s contention with the centre. According to the department, the haven is not registered and not conducive to housing children. In March the department attempted to remove children from the centre, all of whom returned. To ensure that this does not happen again, Masilela said that they are dealing with each child individually. “We are currently tracing the children’s families.” Alternative arrangements will be made for those whose parents cannot be traced.  “We cannot as yet say how long this process will take, because it is lengthy.” He added that the children were receiving continued counselling.  “We are not at war with Mama Esther,” Masilela added.  “If she is willing to cooperate with us, we are ready guide her. She loves the children, but it is not enough.”
