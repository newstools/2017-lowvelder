 MBOMBELA – Culprits who illegally dump waste face a fine of R2 000 per incident, says David Shabangu, spokesman for the City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM).
However, homeowners in the vicinity of Kremetart, Koraalboom and Wilger streets, who recently turned to Lowvelder regarding continuous illegal dumping next to the wetland area known as the Bergvlam Stream, are not soothed by this threat. 
For months now they have witnessed the dumping of household, garden and builders waste right on their doorstep. After all, at all these open spaces there is clear signage indicating that dumping is forbidden, but that evidently does not deter the perpetrators from doing it. 
“Illegal dumping is an offence in terms of the municipal solid waste management by-law,” Shabanbu said about the complaints and promised that CMLM will issue notices to this regard shortly.
He reiterated that the municipality follows a clean city strategy that advocates awareness and cleanliness by informing residents about the impact of littering and illegal dumping, and said they will clear illegal dumping spots on a regular basis to deter further dumping.
According to homeowners in the area, it was cleaned up not so long ago, but the problem persists. 
A gravel road used as thoroughfare between Dr Enos Mabuza Drive and Mandulia Street was recently blocked by the municipality, which curbed the illegal dumping only minimally. 
Shabangu urged residents to use the transfer stations available for that purpose.
Domestic waste and clean building rubble can be deposited free of charge at waste-disposal sites at Hazyview (northern region), White River (eastern region), Barberton (southern region) and the Mbombela transfer station and Tekwane West central waste disposal site (central region).
