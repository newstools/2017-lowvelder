MBOMBELA &#8211; A young woman suffered a broken knee following a hit-and-run accident on Saturday night. Anine Grobler (19) is recuperating in Mediclinic Nelspruit after suffering from a concussion.She said she had attended Innibos with a group of friends, and that they had left the grounds before midnight.&#8220;We walked over Madiba Drive, and we were crossing the road (over the slipway leading from Piet Retief Street) towards Sonpark. I stepped onto the road and that is all I can remember.&#8221;Her friend, Carlou van Deventer who was with Grobler at the time, said, &#8220;I had crossed the road and looked back. Anine and another female friend were still behind us. A white Polo sedan passed Sonpark and took the slipway to turn left onto Madiba Drive towards Barberton. It was going very fast. It hit the other woman slightly, but sent Anine flying. She fell on the side of the road.&#8221;He said his attention was on helping Grobler, and that he therefore did not get a chance to look at the driver or take down the registration number of the vehicle. &#8220;The driver sped off. Whoever it was must have seen that she was injured, but they drove off.&#8221;Van Deventer said the police at the scene had asked if anyone had the registration of the vehicle. &#8220;I did not get the registration number. I did not think someone would do that.&#8221;An advanced paramedic with Netcare 911 treated Grobler on the scene and transported her to hospital. She suffered a concussion and a broken knee. She had a knee operation on Wednesday.Provincial police spokesman, Sgt Gerald Sedibe confirmed that a case of failing to stop after an accident had been opened.The Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison appealed to the public to come forward if anyone had seen anything that could help lead to an arrest.
