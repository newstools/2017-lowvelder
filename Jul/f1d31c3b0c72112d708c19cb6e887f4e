MBOMBELA &#8211; A strange phenomenon was witnessed in the sky above the city yesterday.A bright white light was moving slowly across the sky, followed by what seemed to be a cloudy vapour trail. The light seems to be a falling star, but some people who witnessed this spectacle said it to be a UFO.Another possibility could be that it was simply a falling satellite that was returning to earth. What do you think? Falling star, falling satellite or maybe an encounter from out of this world?
