MBOMBELA &#8211; Gug&#8217;Othandayo (Getting old is a choice), the name of the production, was conceptualised in 2012 when 19 gogos, aged between 50 and 79, decided to take to the stage their personal stories, in particular the issues they face.These narratives, combined with song, revolve around their dealings and disappointments with government departments, and their memory of the trials and tribulations associated with being a domestic worker, as well as the general qualms associated with getting older.It is humorous, entertaining and a real stress buster.In a Facebook message posted shortly after he saw the production, Ismail Mohamed, director of the Grahamstown National Arts Festival, commented: &#8220;Delightfully charming and poignant production performed by about 40 old women about life in the pension lane&#8221;.Prof Lulama Makhubela, deputy vice-chancellor of postgraduate studies, research and development at TUT who had the opportunity to watch the show called it a &#8220;real stress buster and a special way to end women&#8217;s month.&#8220;I giggled like a little girl. The show was an invigorating experience that shattered the notion that only young people have the energy to perform at that level. It affirmed that each one of us has a story to tell, regardless our age or gender,&#8221; he said.Dr Caroline Selepe, director of quality promotion, said the senior mamas challenged her own energy and enthusiasm. &#8220;I was excited to see this old township art making a comeback and becoming a mainstream arts activity.It was a real example of how arts can bring about transformation it unites people. Everybody left the theatre having learnt from one another.&#8221;Sandra Jacobs, media and marketing manager of Innibos, said bringing the production to Innibos was made possible through a partnership with the Mpumalanga Department of Cuture, Sport and Recreation.&#8220;Innibos is proud to stage this traditional theatre production as part of our festival offering this year. The celebration of our country&#8217;s vibrant cultural diversity and a quest for social cohesion should remain a central theme for arts festivals and this is indeed so for Innibos,&#8221; she said.Gug&#8217;Othandayo will be staged at Lowveld High School on Thursday July 6. The show starts at 11:00 and will be approximately 70 minutes long. The full programme is available at Innibos.co.za and tickets from Computicket.
