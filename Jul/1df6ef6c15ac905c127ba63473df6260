 William Mashaba of LVCC ran strong and was just seconds behind second overall winner, Mfanzile Nhlobafsi. Mashaba had to, however, withdraw from the race at the 15-kilometre mark on the Sterkspruit Road due to a calf injury. Nhlobafsi finished with a time of 01:08:33, with Amos Tfwala claiming the third spot on the podium almost four minutes later with a time of 01:12:11.  New member of LVCC and Swaziland resident, Wiwile Mnisi took the first place in the women’s category with a time of 01:29:43. Defending Sudwala Screaming Monster champion, Nomvula Sithole had to settle for second place with a time of 01:32:49. “It was a brand new route and it was much tougher than previous years. The turnout was great with more than 1 000 athletes competing,” said Mark Greeff of LVCC. Pumas’ Folavio Sehohle, who recently returned from the South African 21-kilometre Championships held in Port Elizabeth, was victorious in the 10-kilometre race with a time of 31:05. Hot on his heels was Swaziland’s Melusi Khumalo, a mere second behind Sehohle.  The Pumas athlete placed 20th at the SA Champs. “My body was still recovering after SAs. I jogged with the leaders, and at the 500-metre mark, I broke away. “My main goal now is the South African Cross Country Championships that will take place in Potchefstroom in September,” said Sehohle. KPMG’s Robyn Kaltenbrunn, who hails from Benoni, was the first female to cross the 10-kilometre finish line with a time of 39:41.
