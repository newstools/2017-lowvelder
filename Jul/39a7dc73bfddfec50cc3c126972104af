So we tried to mimic the same feeling by just putting the furniture out there and letting everyone sit as if it is in your own lounge or your own dining area.&#8221;Nicky Paterson and Christine Tyrrell.He said they were holding plenty of functions at Woodenways for charity, not just specifically for promotions.&#8220;We will promote live music first and foremost, and any other events with artists bringing art to the Lowveld,&#8221; said Burger.Mpho Ngobeni and Berthine van Schoor.
