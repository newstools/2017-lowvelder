Slam-poetry lovers will recall that the previous Words in My Mouth, hosted in June, caused quite a controversy. &#8220;Last month, we had Koleka Putuma,&#8221; he recalled.Putuma had called apartheid genocide, which had stirred emotions among some patrons. Yet, according to Mkhonza, the context and nature of her work was generally understood and accepted.Friday&#8217;s highlight was the appearance of poet Joseph Alexandra Brown. Originally from Zambia, he has since moved to Swaziland, where he is known as a musician. Local poets included Ropa Chimusoro, Noah Phiri and Kingdom Khoza.Also read: Lydenburg local claims two tennis titles The group&#8217;s talents were not limited to the spoken word. Mkhonza jammed on his guitar and Phiri grabbed a harmonica &#8211; much to the delight of their friends. &#8220;It is important for us to acknowledge and give exposure to local talent, which we do with Words in MyMouth,&#8221; commented Mkhonza.The Words in My Mouth poetry slam takes place once a month.
