&#8220;It&#8217;s my first time at Innibos and of all the events, the township tour has to be my favourite,&#8221; said Goodstuff Kingbiel from Pretoria.During his time here he has been to a couple of shows. He continues to admire the older actresses and welcomes the new ones whom he hopes to see after 10 years.The township-crawl started at the NG Kerk Westergloed on Koraalboom Avenue in West Acres yesterday, setting off to KaNyamazane.Excitement filled the air for the group curious visitors to explore what Mbombela&#8217;s townships have to offer.The first stop was Tekwane where crawlers got to experience a day mother who not only cares for toddlers while their mothers are at work, but also sells vegetables outside her house which the group had the opportunity to buy.Lunch was served at the Prizlo&#8217;s Grilled Chicken in KaNyamazane where they were enthralled by the dancers from Sijulile Creative Group.&#8220;We thoroughly enjoyed the dancing and it was lovely to see the different cultures of the township,&#8221; said Toekie Doyer, who is visiting with her husband Anton, both from Mashishing.After a hearty serving of pap, chicken dust and mango salad and tomatoes, simply known as atchar, the group was treated to some local beadwork at the market.Local designer Sheila Twala, owner of Buhle bem&#8217;Afrika, showcased her best for these visitors to her township.The day came to a beautiful end in Msogwaba where the group were not only entertained, but got to join the Siyathokoza Culture Group in a dance or two.
