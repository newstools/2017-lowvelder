The SA Hunters and Game Conservation Association (SA Hunters) is calling on the public to abide to existing firearm laws until the current legal challenge on the constitutionality of Section 24 and 28 of the Firearms Control Act has been concluded in the Constitutional Court.SA Hunters CEO, Fred Camphor, said the Association was concerned about misleading and incorrect advice about the status of firearm licences and the renewal process that appeared in newspapers and on social media during the past week. This so-called advice ranged from you do not need to apply for re-licensing your firearm any longer to ask your firearm back from the Police station where you handed it in . The law has not changed. The SAPS notice to appeal against the Gauteng North High Court judgement on 4 July that declared Sections 24 and 28 unconstitutional, suspends the High Court ruling. We are waiting for a clarification from the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court on the legal process following SAPS notice of appeal. Camphor said the Association sent a newsletter to its 41 000 members to request them to be patient and to act within the constraints of the Act and the legal process. Civil disobedience is not a remedy for a complex problem. We request all firearm owners to act responsibly. In a press statement earlier last week, SAPS promised that they would not prosecute any person for being in possession of a firearm of which the licence had lapsed, and they would not destroy any firearms already handed in to the SAPS prior to the Court decision being received. The Constitutional Court is in recess until the end of July and I doubt if we will receive any directives before mid-August, Camphor said.
