MBOMBELA &#8211; According to the Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association&#8217;s (Lefpa), Mr Andr Scheepers,three areas have been affected by three different fires.In the Sudwala area, a fire has been contained with the help of aerial fire fighting. This was achieved without the fire having gotten out of hand. &#8220;Two teams are on the ground. There are no flames, but the risk of the fire being re-ignited from underground is attended to,&#8221; Scheepers said.He stated that he had received reports of two more fires. &#8220;One in the Matsulu and gauge area and one in Hermansburg,&#8221; said Scheepers. Lefpa was not required to attend either scene as the affected areas were not those of Lefpa clients.Community members are fighting these fires. No reports were received of these situations having escalated to crises.&nbsp;
