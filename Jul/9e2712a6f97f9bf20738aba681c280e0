&#8220;How does this video make you feel?&#8221;After 250 hours&#8217; filming, this is what Lee Berg and Sais du Plooy want to know.The duo&#8217;s video tells a South African story &#8211; one with immeasurable depth. &#8220;It is by South Africans, for South Africa,&#8221; says Sais &#8211; a Lowvelder.The idea originated from Lee&#8217;s life story, but reflects the emotions and revelations experienced by many a South African.Lee lost his mother at a young age. &#8220;He would stand at his mother&#8217;s grave &#8211; bereaved, trying to connect with her somehow &#8211; to feel her close to him once again. Through music, he felt connected once again. Not only to the treasured memories of his mother, but to life itself,&#8221; said Sais.The video attests to the struggles and revelations experienced by our youth, many of whom are orphans. The song evokes strong emotions, opening wounds and healing it.Sais and Lee&#8217;s interpretation of the Leonard Cohen hit is unique. From their combination of orchestral music and electric guitar to the evident meaning they find in every word &#8211; the song has never been performed like this before.Musical and interpretational views aside, the music video itself is also one-of-a-kind. &#8220;We did everything ourselves. While filming, we crisscrossed the Western Cape and found parts of ourselves we will forever treasure,&#8221; said Sais.He has come a long way since publishing this video on YouTube three months ago:Since then, his positivity has been tested during a mugging. Left without his cell phone&#8217;s GPS and contacts, he found himself lost in Mitchell&#8217;s Plain. &#8220;I had endured horrors,&#8221; he recalls. In reaction, he decided to open his heart to life &#8211; the good and the bad. Doing so, he says, has forever changed him.&#8220;And I can share my newfound peace with music,&#8221; he says.So&#8230; tell the duo how this video makes you feel.E-mail Lee at: leebergmusic@gmail.com
