MBOMBELA &#8211; The decision came after an unfortunate, alleged racist incident last year sparked large-scale transformation at the golf club.A young black golfer, Jabulane Mabilane, opened a criminal case against the four men present when he was allegedly beaten up on the golf course on October 15.Following an internal disciplinary inquiry by the club, he and his transgressor were suspended.Many were not happy with the way the club had handled the incident, including millionaire businessman, Robert Gumede, who withdrew his annual sponsorship.This is believed to have been the catalyst for the anti-racism protest march to NGC on May 12, organised by Ancyl, Sanco and the EFF.Darren Plumb, club manager.After weeks of negotiations, all parties involved reached a memorandum of understanding (MOU). Included in the 15-point document was the agreement to change the name of the club.At the same general meeting held on June 28, the club&#8217;s constitution was amended in line with the MOU to read that &#8220;any person who is in full-time employment that receives an annual salary less than R180 000 and which the management committee believes requires dispensation in order to afford membership with the club, will pay 50 per cent reduced fees for five years&#8221;. A clause was also added to recommend that the management committee comprise of 50 per cent black and 50 per cent white members, for the sole purpose of transformation and good corporate governance.Club manager, Darren Plumb, said members and management had embraced the changes.We hope the community realises that the golf club is a friendly, family environment for people from all walks of life. We invite all people to become members of the club and enjoy the facilities on offer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One of the siSwati meanings of Mbombela is &#8216;a lot of people in a small space&#8217;, which is exactly what a golf club is, like-minded people coming together to enjoy similar interests.&#8221;Another of the club&#8217;s commitments was to provide a core group of caddies with medical and funeral benefits. Plumb said the club is currently running a caddie course, which any applicant can apply for and participate in. At the end of the course, a group of top candidates will be chosen and permanently employed by the golf club.
