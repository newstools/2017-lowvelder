MBOMBELA &#8211; The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) said this past weekend it &#8220;noted with concern misrepresentation of facts on aspects associated with rhino-horn trade&#8221;. Following reports last week that private owners were planning auctions of their rhino-horn stockpiles, the DEA said in a statement that the commercial, international trade in rhino horn is and remains prohibited in terms of the international protocols, particularly the Convention on International Trade in Species (CITES) of fauna and flora.&#8220;The department wishes to place on record that the planned sale of rhino horn by private rhino owners is for domestic trade only.Domestic trade in rhino horn is subject to the issuance of the relevant permits in terms of the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (Nemba), its regulations and applicable provincial legislation.&#8221; In terms of Nemba a permit is required to possess, transport and trade in rhino horns and any derivatives or products of horn and no person is allowed to sell, donate or in any way acquire rhino horn without a permit issued by the relevant provincial conservation department.The department has developed an electronic database that will capture extensive details on all individual rhino horns in private and government-owned stockpiles and all newly acquired horns which will be entered into the database on a monthly basis.&#8221;Six provinces have conducted audit inspections in respect of privately owned horns. The DEA is currently conducting ad hoc inspections to verify the provincial audits.&#8220;Through the audit, the department intends to ensure that every horn is tagged with a microchip, that DNA testing has been conducted on the horn, and that all horn is measured, weighed, marked and captured on the national database.The DEA is also evaluating the comments received from members of the public and interested parties following the publication of the three draft notices relating to the management of the domestic rhino-horn trade.
