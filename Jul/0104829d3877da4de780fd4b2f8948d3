A local family were delighted to witness a female hyena feeding her young during a visit to the Kruger National Park on Sunday. The Vosloos were driving near Afsaal, a well-known picnic spot, when they spotted a family of about 20 hyenas resting in the shadows. A female and her three pups walked onto the tar road, where the mother lay down in the middle of the road to let her pups drink from her. After a while, all four got up and walked off the road. The family shared a few of their photos with Corridor Gazette and said they were very lucky to be there.Photo: Simon Vosloo
