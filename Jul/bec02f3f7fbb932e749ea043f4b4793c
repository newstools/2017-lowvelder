MBOMBELA &#8211; Miguel Schofield, Mr Mini-Teen South Africa 2017, did his bit for Madiba Day at Betty&#8217;s Haven. This is an annual day of giving and selflessness that immortalises our former president&#8217;s legacy.At 17:00 on Tuesday, he arrived at the orphanage with treats for its residents. He had prepared popcorn himself, which he packed into paper packets and handed out to the children. Also, he dished out various sweet treats. The children, in Betty Mandlazi&#8217;s care, also had their faces painted. Along with Miguel, they sang religious hymns and participated in prayer.&#8220;We are very grateful. It was a lot of fun,&#8221; said Mandlazi.Click on these images for a slideshow:
