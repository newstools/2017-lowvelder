Our executive mayor preaches clean audits. We are proud of this achievement, as it shows we are addressing the problems of the past,&#8221; municipal spokesman, Mr Cyril Ripinga said.Internal auditing helps to minimise the risk the municipality faces and is a fundamental department, as things can go wrong without it.&#8220;They check if we&#8217;re attaining our clean governance goals and look at our loopholes. We come from a difficult past, and since the appointment of the new leadership and internal auditors, we&#8217;ve seen a great improvement,&#8221; Ripinga stated.The mayor, Ms Thulisile Khoza, said that she was very happy with Sifunda and his team&#8217;s achievement. &#8220;That they&#8217;re number two in the country means we are doing something right.
