MBOMBELA &#8211; The seminar, which was organised by Juanitte Pieterse to launch Oway hair products in the Lowveld, attracted representatives from top salons in the city on Tuesday.They were educated about the wide range of available stock and were treated to a superb canap lunch on the verandah overlooking the hills of Mbombela. Oway is a brand aimed at revolutionising the hair-styling industry, providing an extensive range of hair-care products, while making little impact on the environment. It offers customers a multi-sensory experience with exclusive services created for beauty, well-being and relaxation. During the seminar, stylists were also given the opportunity to stock Oway&#8217;s affordable salon-only products. Pieterse said she was satisfied with the positive reaction from the attendees.People really liked the product, so it has gone very well. Oway works with all the senses, making it different from other products on the market,&#8221; she said.One of the guests, Jenny Streak from Je t&#8217;aime hair salon, said it was a refreshing, new approach to hairdressing.These are products for the mind, body and soul. It has been great to learn about something brand new and exciting,&#8221; Streak told Lowvelder.Pearl Ngomane of Face and Body Synergy found the seminar interesting because Oway is an organic range of products. &#8220;We don&#8217;t use herbal products at our business at the moment, which is why it has been very informative.&#8221; &#8220;The scalp treatments are also intriguing because of their detoxing qualities,&#8221; she said. Artistic Hair Club&#8217;s Bonnie Nailer agreed. She added that the environment-friendly aspect was a bonus. &#8220;I like the fact that the stock is all organic and not harsh on the scalp, but nourishing instead. The packaging is eco-friendly because most of the bottles are glass instead of plastic. This is a product range good for the environment as well as the body,&#8221; Nailer said. The city&#8217;s Oway premises opens at the Sonpark Centre on July 1.Also read: Three smart ways to use your hair oils
