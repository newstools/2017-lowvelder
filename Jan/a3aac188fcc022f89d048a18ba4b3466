MBOMBELA &#8211; The City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) has further extended the completion date to the end of February.The terminus is part of a multimillion-rand programme to develop a public-transport hub in the Mbombela CBD and was supposed to be completed in August 2015.In December Lowvelder wrote about the owners and tenants of Canary Walk Mall who were fed up with the slow progress of construction, as the mall was not getting the number of feet through its doors as originally expected. Read the background: Frustration at transport hub standstillThe delay in conclusion of the project (at that time) was attributed to the subcontractor, AJW Steel, which had failed to complete the steelwork on structures at the terminus. Spokesman for CMLM, Mr Joseph Ngala, said the subcontractor had been lying about not being paid for the remaining work.We have a paper trail showing that he has (been paid). He must have misused the funds for something other than the project and now he cannot pay his workers,&#8221; Ngala told the paper.CMLM stepped in and replaced the subcontractor, transferring the steelwork responsibilities to Quality Steel, a well-known structural steel and civils construction company in Mbombela, to finish the job.Ngala told the paper on Wednesday that according to Quality Steel&#8217;s work programme, the project will be finished by the end of February. Work is set to begin on Monday.&#8220;Quality Steel will also fix and finish all the items that will come out on the snag list of the work done by the previous subcontractor, and will be requested to do the sheeting as well,&#8221; he said.The company&#8217;s Mr Andre Potgieter confirmed the steelwork would only be completed by the end of February, because there is much repair work to be done on the existing structures.&#8220;We have all materials here and everything is in place to get the show on the road on Monday,&#8221; he said.Also read: Canary Walk officially opens its doorsNgala did not respond to why work was only beginning on January 30, instead of earlier in the month. Potgieter said it may have been because the offices of the main contractor only opened this week.He also emphasised that Quality Steel&#8217;s mandate would not include the roof sheeting.We are steel specialists. There are also sheeting specialists. There is work for everyone and we do not want to do everything ourselves,&#8221; he said.Mr Fred Kinnear, owner of Canary Walk Mall, said he is monitoring the situation and just wants the project finished as soon as possible.
