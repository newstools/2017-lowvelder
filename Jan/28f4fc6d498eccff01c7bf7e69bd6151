Water Yes, it is simple. However, many people do not like water and opt for a soda instead. Try drinking one glass of water before every glass of soda or juice. Sodas contain carbonated gas that bloats up your belly and stretches your stomach. Eight glasses of water is too much for some and too little for others. Go by the rule of thumb, whereby you need to drink one glass of water per day for every 10 kilograms that you weigh. If you do not like water but want to cut out the sweet stuff, try adding peppermint leaves, kiwi, cucumber and lemon slices to your water bottle.Fiber Fiber keeps everything moving, granted you have enough water in your system to make it a smooth ride, so to speak. If you have a low fiber diet, increase your intake gradually to avoid uncomfortable situations. Fiber does not only come in the form of wholegrain, fresh fruit and vegetables contain lots of fiber, especially when you do not peel them, such as apples or potatoes.Watch out for bubblegum Chewing gum often tricks your stomach into thinking it will be receiving food soon, so it starts its digestion process. This is fine if you have just eaten but if it has been a couple of hours, you might start craving a snack, resulting in an unplanned intake of food. You may also swallow air in the time that you are chewing, which results in extra bloating.Slow down Chew slowly, as you are less likely to overeat. The more you chew, the less your digestive system needs to work to process your food, which will aid in combating the bloat.Walk it off You do not need a rigorous exercise plan. When you are done with your evening meal, do not just sit down. Stay up for 30 minutes. Wash dishes, do some laundry, mop the floor, play with the kids or the dog. This is especially important for people that eat later in the evening, as going to sleep on a full stomach is a recipe for bloating.&nbsp;
