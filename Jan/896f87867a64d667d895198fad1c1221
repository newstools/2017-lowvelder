MBOMBELA &#8211; The trial of the Barberton couple accused of child pornography was postponed on Monday due to their request for an Afrikaans-speaking attorney. The couple were caught with an alleged explicit pornographic video of their own seven-year-old daughter on a cellphone.The father was in the process of selling the cellphone when a vigilant shop assistant noticed a video of a woman and a little girl apparently performing a strip dance and making explicit gestures. They were arrested at Cash Converters in Mbombela in August 2013. The girl was moved to a place of safety. The father (41) and mother (37), who are both Afrikaans-speaking and cannot be named to protect the identity of their minor daughter, appeared in the regional court on charges of possessing, manufacturing, and distributing child pornography, as well as grooming for sexual purposes.The court had provided Legal Aid representation, but the couple refused due to the attorney being unable to speak Afrikaans.They requested the court to allow them more time to obtain private legal representation. Magistrate Ms Vanessa Joubert granted their request, and postponed the matter to January 31.
