MBOMBELA &#8211; Penryn College&#8217;s matric class of 2016 produced another year of exceptional achievements. The school attributed the excellent results to the pupils&#8217; diligence and support of parents and teachers. &#8220;For the 19th consecutive year, all the matrics of Penryn College have passed,&#8221; the school said in a statement.Each of the 106 pupils obtained results qualifying them for entry into tertiary studies. A full 90,6 per cent are eligible to enter bachelor&#8217;s degrees at university, a percentage well above the 87,6 average of the Independent Examinations Board&#8217;s (IEB) matrics.Between them, they achieved 134 distinctions. Gabby Olbrich and Chris Symonds each obtained seven. Gabby, who was also the class&#8217; dux and scored a spot on the IEB Commendable Achievements list for matrics in the top five per cent in five subjects, said it was hard work. &#8220;In order to achieve this goal, I had to commit myself to putting the work in and that made it difficult, but I quite enjoyed the process.&#8221;She will be studying actuarial science at Stellenbosch University this year. Chris plans to study mechanical engineering at the same university. &#8220;Being able to design something and see it being put into place must be great,&#8221; he explained. He added he was surprised to earn seven, as as he didn&#8217;t expect to get one for English. &#8220;I was hoping for six, but obviously I tried for as many as possible.&#8221;READ MORE: Penryn s matrics excel with 100 % pass rateTammy Park and Penny Wolhuter each achieved six distinctions.
