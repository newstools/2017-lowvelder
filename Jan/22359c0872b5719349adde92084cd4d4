WESTONARIA &#8211; A rescue operation, undertaken yesterday by staff from the National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) to save the surviving chickens of a motor vehicle accident, turned dramatic when they were attacked.A truck carrying more than 3 000 chickens had overturned on the N12 in the vicinity of Lenasia and Westonaria, west of Johannesburg.Bystanders became hostile to the NSPCA staff, who were accompanied and assisted by personnel from the Roodepoort and Westonaria SPCAs, it said in a statement today.They were &#8220;throwing stones and other missiles at the rescue team and officers of the SAPS and JMPD officers at the scene,&#8221; spokesman Mr Jaco Pieterse said.&#8220;Undeterred and thankfully unharmed, the team continued to assist the animals. Damage was sustained to an NSPCA vehicle belonging to and used by the Farm Animal Protection Unit.&#8221;At the scene, it was determined that some were so badly injured as a result of the accident that there was no alternative other than humanely euthanasing these birds to end their suffering.The surviving chickens were transferred to another truck and removed to safety.&#8220;Because of our over-riding concerns for the welfare of the chickens, the matter did not end there. NSPCA personnel went to the farm where the chickens had been taken to ensure that the animals were offloaded timeously and handled humanely.&#8220;Further examination of each bird took place to ensure that not a single one was left injured and suffering. As a result, more chickens had to be humanely euthanased on the farm after being offloaded,&#8221; Pieterse said.Investigations by the NSPCA uncovered that the end of breeder chickens had been loaded in Standerton and were on their way to what is known as a cull outlet near Randfontein. These birds have been used as intensive breeding machines throughout their short lives. When of no further commercial use, they were packed into crates and destined for sale in the open air to the informal market. In most cases these birds are handled inhumanely, placed for sale without food, water or protection from the elements. Pro-active inspections are undertaken by the NSPCA s Farm Animal Protection Unit country-wide. We need public support, moral and financial, to end this cruelty, he concluded.
