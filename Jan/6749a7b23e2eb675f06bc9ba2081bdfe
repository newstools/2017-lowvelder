&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell them about that. What will they think?&#8221;This was the reaction I got when suggesting that I play open cards with my first boss about my depression. I still told him.It is five years and two employees later and I still suffer from the disease that many call &#8220;the black dog.&#8221;Yet this has not prevented me from giving my best in the workplace and becoming known for quality reporting. The fact that my bosses know about my illness empowers me. When I&#8217;m not 10-4, they understand. When I am more than 10-4, they see to it that I don&#8217;t burn out.If you suffer from depression and have not yet told your boss, I suggest you do it now. If will free your soul.

Depression affects the body (I get extremely tired when I am sick), feelings, thoughts and behaviours. These symptoms manifest in the patient&#8217;s behaviour.And know this: it is out of his or her control.A person with a cold cannot be ordered to stop sneezing, coughing or sniffing. Likewise, a depression sufferer cannot have more enthusiasm and less of a dead-person-walking feeling on demand. They cannot just stop crying or focus intensely. It is just not possible.According to allaboutdepression.com, these tell-tale signs may indicate that someone in your office suffers from depression:If your employee has not confided in you about his/her condition, it may be that he fears your negative conclusion about his/her abilities. Depression was once a highly stigmatised problem, but more and more people are seeing it for what it is: the cross that an intelligent, perfectly capable person happens to bare.If you know someone who suffers from depression, just be there and accept them.
