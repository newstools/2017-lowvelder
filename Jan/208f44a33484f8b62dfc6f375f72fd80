According to unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund, January 2017 will see the first of what the Automobile Association (AA) predicts to be a series of fuel price hikes in the new year.&#8220;The Rand has weakened against the US dollar since mid-December, while international petroleum prices have continued their upward march,&#8221; the Association said.&#8220;However, despite the Rand&#8217;s recent weakness, it was comparatively strong in the first half of December, and the anticipated fuel price rise is entirely attributable to petroleum strength.&#8221;If international petroleum prices had remained stable from November, South African fuel prices would have dropped by around two cents to the litre in the new year. Instead, fuel is expected to increase by around 51 cents a litre, 40 cents for diesel and 43 cents for illuminating paraffin.&#8220;It is too early to know at what price level oil supply will match demand in the wake of the OPEC decision to cut production,&#8221; the Association commented, adding that it expected 2017 to be a difficult year for motorists.
