Senior state advocate, Ms Isabet Erwee, referred to the circumstances under which he was caught on December 11, 2011.Lowvelder previously reported that game rangers patrolling the Tshokwane area came across three suspect individuals. After having poached a rhino, the accused had come across two more rhino horns and took them into their possession.

Although many suspects are killed during contacts or end up losing limbs, the lure of money is stronger than the fear of death,&#8221; she stressed. According to Erwee, strict sentences should dissuade prospective poachers from partaking in these criminal activities.The magistrate, Mr Andr Geldenhuys, passed a combined sentence of 28 years against Ngubane. He took into account the five years Ngubane had served while in custody and mentioned that his total sentence would effectively amount to 33 years.
