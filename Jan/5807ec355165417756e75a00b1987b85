MBOMBELA &#8211; In the SPAR festive season sticker competition, which was once again held over Christmas, a lucky Lowvelder reader scored big by winning a R10 000 SPAR voucher.Liezl Botma was the lucky shopper who found the sticker in the newspaper on December 23, ensuring she had an extra special festive season. She can use the voucher on a shopping spree at any one of the awesome SPAR stores in and around the city.Botma said it was a big surprise. Although she is a regular shopper at Crossing SUPERSPAR she usually buys her Lowvelder at a traffic light. On this particular day, she was shopping with a friend and picked up two newspapers. &#8220;That was just the one I ended up with,&#8221; she said.However, she did not read it &#8211; only when her husband did so that evening the sticker was discovered. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe him at first. I was sure there was something else you had to do to claim the prize. But when I phoned them the next day, they said all you had to do was find the sticker.&#8221;She said the cash went a long way towards buying Christmas food for her family. &#8220;And all of us have a little less money in January,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It is nice to have the extra food money.&#8221;She concluded that if there ever were another competition, she would definitely buy her Lowvelder from Crossing. Amanda van Jaarsveldt, SPAR&#8217;s advertising manager in the Lowveld, said that, as has become tradition, the SPAR Festive Season sticker competition brought loads of excitement to the Lowveld over the festive season period.&#8220;The sticker was randomly placed in a newspaper on the day, and Botma was the lucky reader who found it. SPAR will continue to give back to the community we serve and there will definitely be another festive season sticker to look forward to at the end of this year!&#8221;
