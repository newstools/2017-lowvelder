Somewhere out there is a little girl crying for her bear. It is our mission to reunite the two. Hylke said that the help of Lowvelder&#8216;s onliners &#8220;was fantastic.&#8221; I am so sad for the little girl. In our younger years we all always had one beloved teddy. Everybody can relate to the heartache it gives when you suddenly lose it. I want her to find it back because the bear was obviously loved intensely since it looks very used and very much hugged, said Hylke.She is a former school teacher who now devotes her life to training dogs. She loves dogs, but at present is the owner of only one.Hylke is prepared to courier the teddy anywhere in the world to reunite the bear with her rightful owner. She asked anyone who can help to contact her hylke77@gmail.com or on Facebook Hylke Walters.Read about a German tourist losing his soft toy companion in the KNPHylke Walters and Sander Leenstra
