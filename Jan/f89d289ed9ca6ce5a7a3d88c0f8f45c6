Ms Solange Soares, spokesman for TRAC N4, confirmed a noticeable increase in traffic at the toll gates on this route over the volumes recorded last year.However, despite the best efforts of the provincial Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison (DCSSL) to increase visible policing, a number of road users still lost their lives.On one of the busiest days, Monday, 11 people died in three separate accidents, two of which occurred on the N4.In late the afternoon, five people travelling from Mbombela, were killed when their vehicle collided with an oncoming truck on the N4 Toll Road bypass near Schoemanskloof. The truck driver sustained slight injuries.DCSSL spokesman, Mr Joseph Mabuza said it is believed the driver of the car may have lost control before colliding with the truck. Netcare911 spokesman, Ms Athlende Mathe, confirmed all five died on the scene.Earlier that day, three people lost their lives when their vehicle overturned on the N4 between Mbombela and Machadodorp. Two others sustained serious injuries and were rushed to a nearby hospital.At 20:30 that same night, a head-on collision on the R50 between Leandra and Standerton claimed another three lives.READ MORE: Stolen vehicle rolls down mountainBoth drivers of the vehicles involved, along with a five-year-old passenger died. The child&#8217;s mother sustained serious injuries and was treated at Evander Hospital.&#8220;Investigations are underway to determine what may have led to the accidents,&#8221; Mabuza said.The same day, 22 people were injured in an accident on the Roosenekal Road near Lydenburg when a taxi and two bakkies collided at around 16:30. According to Mathe, Netcare911 paramedics worked alongside provincial emergency services. One person in a critical condition was stabilised and airlifted to a nearby hospital. The other 21 sustained minor injuries.DCSSL MEC, Mr Pat Ngomane, has called on motorists to remain alert to avoid accidents. He appealed to road users to tolerate one another, avoid speeding, dangerous overtaking or driving while tired, and to plan their journeys to accommodate delays on the road.Although roadworks on the N4 were halted over the holidays, the stop-and-go system hindered traffic on the Waterval Boven route.Soares said traffic peaked on Monday, with as many as 1 800 vehicles passed, travelling West through the Middelburg Plaza in an hour, and more than 700 in an hour at Nkomazi Plaza.She added that they expected another surge this Sunday and Monday as the public schools open on Wednesday and urged the public to be patient and stay safe.Ngomane added that law enforcers would continue to deal harshly with intoxicated drivers.&#8220;We should always ensure our vehicles are roadworthy and that those who drive are fit and proper to do so in order to avoid crashes.&#8221;At the time of going to print, the department did not yet have Mpumalanga&#8217;s road fatalities for the festive season available.&nbsp;
