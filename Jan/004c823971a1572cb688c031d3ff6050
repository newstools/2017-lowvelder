MBOMBELA &#8211; CMLM CFO Mr Oupa Mokoena and the provincial Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) confirmed yesterday that the payment had been made. At the time of going to press, the power utility had not confirmed that it would not continue with the planned cuts, which would have seen supply to four substations cut for four-and-a-half hours every day.Yet, it is understood that the city is out of the woods, for now. However, questions remain.Also watch: LATEST IN POWER DEBACLE: City of Mbombela to settle Eskom debtExecutive mayor Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi announced during the special council meeting on Wednesday, where council resolved to obtain an overdraft from the bank to pay Eskom, that 10 officials &#8220;who stole money&#8221; have been suspended.Mr Joseph Ngala.Yet, municipality spokesman, Mr Joseph Ngala, denied this, the next day. &#8220;Employees who have received any communique from the accounting officer know that such correspondence is for soliciting information from them as per the findings of the internal audit committee. These matters remain internal until concluded,&#8221; he told Lowvelder yesterday.Mokoena added that a commitment agreement was concluded by the close of business on Wednesday too. It is one of the requirements for the power utility to keep the supply on. These included a cash payment, a council resolution that current accounts will be honoured going forward and producing a payment plan for the arrears supported by a council resolution.Also read: Still no answers: paid-up residents fuming over power cutsEskom intended to cut supply to Nelsriver, Delta, Mbombela Stadium and White River over a R70-million debt CLML owed. This had been reduced from the R133 million it owed in November, but it failed to stick to its repayment agreement in December.Mathonsi said the municipality cannot afford to have a &#8220;cut-out&#8221; in the city. &#8220;I want to assure the house that we are on top of this. We engaged with our (municipal) banker and an overdraft of R50 million was agreed upon. The overdraft should be paid off by the end of March as we had (originally) planned to do with the Eskom account,&#8221; he said.The numbers explained The debt of R70,5 million owed to Eskom was the council&#8217;s account for December 2016 which the municipality failed to pay. It did settle up an amount of R99 million on December 2 to settle debt that was outstanding from November 30.Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi.Council had managed to pay back a portion of the money but still owed close to R50 million, hence the application for the overdraft. Its interest would be less than that charged by Eskom for late payment.According to Mathonsi&#8217;s council report, CMLM had expected more than the R136,8 million they had received from National Treasury (NT).&#8220;The equitable share was reduced due to the NT not approving certain unspent conditional grant roll-overs amounting to R48,5 million,&#8221; the report read.The repercussions Council has committed to prioritising the Eskom account in future, but this will have roll-on effects in other areas.&#8220;The payment of the Eskom bulk accounts must be prioritised going forward as the municipality cannot afford the bad publicity and reputational damage that is caused by the non-payment of the Eskom bulk accounts,&#8221; Mathonsi&#8217;s report read.By the end of January we need to commit to paying the current account,&#8221; he told council.Also read: Eskom to go ahead with power cutsMathonsi said although prioritising the Eskom account may cause problems elsewhere in future, the municipality could not afford to lose the account.&#8220;This is a very serious matter and will have serious consequences. We won&#8217;t be able to pay all contractors as we used to,&#8221; Mathonsi told council.Accountability According to local governance practitioner, Mr Frik M lder, &#8220;The mere fact that account-paying consumers are punished by the inability of the municipalities as organs of state to pay their accounts to Eskom can only be attributed to gross derelict of constitutional obligations.&#8221;In a document sent to Lowvelder, he wrote that the electricity cuts could have been prevented if the mechanisms provided for in the Constitution had been put in motion when the first warning signs presented themselves. He added that the derelict of duty started when chief accounting officers did not follow legal prescripts and procedures as it may affect their performance bonuses.Mr Noko Seanego.&#8220;Executive mayors and committees failed their oversight and governing obligations as this could lead to them falling into party political disfavour with their provincial masters,&#8221; he wrote.&#8220;Municipal councillors were ordered by their caucus leaders not to make any waves as this could bring the council into ill repute which could lead to them being expelled from the political party.&#8221;He emphasised that councillors need to ensure that the political structures (committees) and political office bearers (mayors and speakers) perform their obligations legally and diligently.Pressure must be exerted on MECs charged with local government and finance to exercise their overseeing obligations and take remedial action when municipalities fail to pay their debtors in time.&#8220;If need be, financial recovery plans should be prepared, implemented and where necessary municipal councils be dissolved and new elections be held.&#8221;Opposition&#8217;s complaints DA Mpumalanga announced yesterday that it would call for a full-scale inquiry into Premier David Mabuza and Cogta MEC, Ms Refilwe Mtshweni, following &#8220;their failure to prevent the pending electricity cuts in some municipalities&#8221;.Representatives from opposition parties, the DA and the EFF, also expressed their frustration in council.Mr Steve Schormann.DA leader in the municipality, Mr Steve Schormann, told council on Wednesday that there has been a loss in confidence in the executive management and council as a whole. &#8220;We were shocked on Friday when we were confronted with Eskom&#8217;s final notice. We can&#8217;t say you lied to us but we can&#8217;t say you told us the whole truth. Council as a whole gets very little information as the executive council is not passing it down,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need to differentiate ourselves and show that CMLM is going to look after the rate payer, businesses and residents in this municipality.&#8221;Ms Trudie Grove&#8217;Morgan, DA councillor for White River, told Lowvelder she had raised a motion in council in 2015 for all electricity payments to be ring fenced and paid directly to Eskom. The motion was adopted by council but weeks later, the mayoral committee responded to say the proposal was not financially sound, Grove&#8217;Morgan said.At that stage, the Eskom account was R96 million in arrears in January 2015. The issue of Eskom came up in the finance committee again in October 2016. The CFO responded saying they have an arrangement in place. Now, to my surprise, nothing has been done and the rate payers are the ones on the losing end,&#8221; she said.What else we still do not know The municipality has not sufficiently explained the following: The money paid to CMLM by residents for electricity, was not paid to Eskom. Why was this not done, and where did the money go? Mathonsi blames non-payment on the amalgamation of Mbombela and Umjindi municipalities in August: it inherited R168,6 million debt from Mbombela and R12 million from Umjindi. When the municipalities merged, the Mbombela mayor, municipal manager, Mr Noko Seanego, and CFO remained in their positions. How much is owed to CMLM by its customers and provincial departments? Ngala claims approximately R60 million is owed by provincial departments &#8211; including public works, roads and transport, and rural development and land reform, for electricity in particular. The paper has asked the municipality to provide it with figures of which areas and individual customers owe which percentage of the outstanding amount. Ngala could not answer: &#8220;This is due to the fact that the information not readily available and departments are on departmental strategic-planning sessions currently,&#8221; he said. M lder said municipal officials may not have followed correct procedure because it would affect their performance bonuses. It it unclear how many municipal employees or officials received bonuses in 2016.
