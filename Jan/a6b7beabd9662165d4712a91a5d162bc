MBOMBELA &#8211; The redistribution of land has topped the discussions of the high-level panel on the assessment of key legislation and acceleration of fundamental change so far.A public hearing was held in Mpumalanga on Wednesday and Thursday, the seventh province the panel has visited so far. Locals had an opportunity to voice their dissatisfaction on a number of issues during the hearings held at Church Unlimited.The panel is commissioned by parliament and chaired by former president, Mr Kgalema Motlanthe. The national roadshow aims to to meet and engage citizens and understand how democratic laws have changed their lives.Panelist, Dr Anika Claasens, said poverty and inequality were also some of the major talking points. &#8220;We have already visited seven out of the nine provinces and one of the issues that has come out mostly is land. People are very unhappy about the slow pace of land reform and how most laws are not clearly outlined on how they protect citizens,&#8221; she said.The panels&#8217;s focus areas are poverty, unemployment, inequality, and the equitable distribution of wealth. Other areas on discussion are land reform and rural development, social cohesion and nation building.&#8220;Our problem is leadership,&#8221; said participant Ms Maria Mthombothi. &#8220;There is no engagement and we are not afforded an opportunity to choose our councillors. Our municipalities only present us with them without proper election channels.&#8221;Some said the government was not effective in fast-tracking land redistribution. &#8220;Our government doesn&#8217;t want to facilitate the talks between land claimants and the farm owners. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so much violence as far as land claiming is concerned,&#8221; said another participant, Mr Sipho Zitha.Claasens said although they do not have the power to change the laws, it was important to recommend changes to parliament based on their findings, so that changes can be made. &#8220;We believe that if we can identify the problems and show which ones are widespread throughout the country, we can be able to show which part, of any law have been well implemented,&#8221; she said.According to Claasens, one of the worrying issues that has come out from their engagements with communities is their lack of knowledge on how they can hold their leaders accountable. &#8220;Some complain that they can&#8217;t go to court because they don&#8217;t have money to pay legal fees. One of the things we are going to look at is what are the complaints mechanisms and ways that people can use to enforce accountability,&#8221; she said.The panel was also pleased about how citizens were brave enough to even name the leaders who are letting them down.After completion of the work in August, the panel will report its findings to parliament and propose how the laws can be better implemented to favour citizens.
