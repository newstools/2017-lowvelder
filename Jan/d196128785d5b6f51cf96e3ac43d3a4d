WHITE RIVER &#8211; A quick glance at Daniel Brink does not immediately reveal that the 18-year-old is suffering from a rare bone disease called hereditary multiple exostoses (HME). In fact the jovial music lover said the sickness will never stop him from living his life to the fullest. HME is a genetic condition that affects bone development and people with it develop growths on the ends of long bones as well as on some flat ones such as the shoulder blade and the pelvis. These growths typically develop during childhood and adolescence.Brink attends music lessons at the Casterbridge Music Development Academy (CMDA) during the week. CMDA provides a platform for local youngsters, especially from previously disadvantaged backgrounds, to develop an interest in music and the performing arts.On the afternoon of Lowvelder&#8217;s visit, he was scheduled for his monthly check-up at Rob Ferreira Hospital but had opted to go for his lessons before the appointment. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let the condition affect my love of music. Music is very close to my heart and every time I play, I feel a sense of companionship.&#8221;Daniel plays piano, guitar and is also a singerDespite minor difficulties in moving his arms, fingers and legs, Brink has taught himself how to play a guitar, piano and drums. His love for music developed at age 11 and ever since he has never looked back. In 2011, he joined CMDA to polish his playing abilities.&#8220;My love for music has grown over the years,&#8221; he said. He also writes songs but he cannot perform them at times due to his condition. &#8220;Sometimes I have breathing problems and as a result I can&#8217;t sing for a long time, but I will keep on writing music and will find someone to sing for me,&#8221; he said.Brink has found a new family and a support structure at the academy. In 2014, he was part of the band that opened for the Parlotones at Casterbridge.&#8220;It was very exciting to play before such an established music group. I look up to them and I am glad I have met them through CMDA,&#8221; he said.He has also played at the White River Golf Club during a fund-raising event. Music programme manager at CMDA, Ms Karen Loots, said the agency was proud of Daniel&#8217;s courage to overcome his condition and make something better out of his passion for music.&#8220;He is a very humble and matured boy. We know we are mentoring a star and he relates well with other learners at the agency,&#8221; she said.
