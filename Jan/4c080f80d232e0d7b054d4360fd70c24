KAAPMUIDEN &#8211; Frustrated road users have resorted to creative means to get government&#8217;s attention concerning the condition of the R38 between Barberton and Kaapmuiden.Three road signs which look as though they were erected by the Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport (DPWRT), have been erected on the 52,7-kilometre road.They bear the provincial government&#8217;s logo and warn, &#8220;Poor maintenance of road. High accident rate and increasing death toll.&#8221;The road have frequent potholes.Another says the road is in desperate need of repair and resurfacing. The road is narrow and mostly bordered by trees and grass.The road reserve is narrow or in places, non existent, which makes it difficult and dangerous for users to pull off the road. The surface is uneven and riddled with potholes for the first 10 kilometres from Kaapmuiden towards Barberton.Spokesman for DPWRT, Mr David Nkambule, said routine maintenance and ongoing patching up was done regularly.He said the R38 was old and some sections required rehabilitation.&#8220;The department uses a road management system called RAMS to assess conditions on all provincial roads. We are therefore aware of all the conditions of the provincial roads, including the R38,&#8221; he said.The signs were erected by concerned road users.Nkambule added that the department will continue with its routine road maintenance. The department also sometimes puts up its own signs to warn motorists, but these were often stolen or knocked over.
