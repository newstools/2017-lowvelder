SKUKUZA &#8211; Since Elaine Kruer visited the Kruger National Park (KNP) for the first time in 1996, she has come back every year, either to the KNP or the Kgalagadi, sometimes doing both in the same trip. But that is not enough for this Krugerholic anymore.&#8220;Last year, I decided that only coming once a year simply wasn&#8217;t enough to satisfy my love for your exquisite country and its congenial people. So I now plan two trips per year. I spend the months between daydreaming of my return,&#8221; said Kruer, who lives in Florida, USA.
