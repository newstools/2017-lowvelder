Let s be honest, as exciting as travelling can be, it can also bring a lot of stress. This is precisely the reason why some progressive airports, bus and train terminals all over the world have dedicated places for people to unwind. However, if you re not lucky enough to be travelling to those places, these tips to unwind should do the trick. Bob Marley once said One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain. This rings true in almost every life scenario but especially when in limbo waiting to get to your holiday destination. Throw in some feel good tunes into a playlist for good measure and you re one step closer to a blissful holiday. One of most zen places at airports and bus terminals are book shops. For some reason, there is always a soothing sound in the background, chairs to sit down and dive into an interesting book or magazine of your choice. There are not many people who do not enjoy food so it makes sense to want to find a great spot to sit down and indulge in a delicious meal before heading off into the sunset. Good food will not only give you sustenance but will also help you chill and relax before departing. It sounds a little counterproductive, but there is no harm in getting some last minute gifts and things before departing. This will not only take your mind off of the actual travelling but it also means one less item to do on your holiday to do list. Just make sure you don&#8217;t get too shocked at some of the prices. Most places of transit are fully equipped with coffee bars or beer houses to take the edge off before you travel. You can check the sports updates, strike a conversation with a fellow traveler or even find a corner and read the newspaper over a refreshing beverage. Just make sure you do not get too buzzed before departing or you might regret it.
