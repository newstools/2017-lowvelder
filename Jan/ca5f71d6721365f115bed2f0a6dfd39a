MBOMBELA &#8211; The man who could not smile for 12 years is embarking on a brighter future.Mr Sipho Hadebe has a new lease on life after undergoing an operation to his face in November.Thanks to Lowveld Hospital, Hadebe underwent the surgery to remove a tumor on his face. The growth would have fatally blocked his airway within a year.This after Mbombela&#8217;s state hospital, Rob Ferreira, was unable to help. He was referred to Steve Biko Hospital in Pretoria and placed on a seven-year waiting list.Hadebe is now recovering from the operation and will be starting a new job soon. He told Lowvelder his recovery was going well and he would be getting his old job back. He looks forward to starting work again, as his wife, Lindiwe, had been supporting them financially since he lost his job due to his condition.Lowveld Hospital&#8217;s customer relationship manager, Ms Lisa Volbrecht, said Hadebe would need more surgeries to have teeth implants put in and to rebuild his muscles in his jaw. &#8220;We still have a long way to go.&#8221;Maxillofacial surgeon Dr Pieter Scheepers&#8217; secretary, Ms Suzanne Knouwds, said Hadebe had his check-up and they were continuing to track his recovery. &#8220;We will be monitoring his progress for the next couple of months. The next date for an operation has not yet been determined,&#8221; she said.Scheepers performed the massive seven-hour reconstructive surgery, free of charge, with the help ofDr Barry Geldenhuys. The hospital also made its operating theatre, equipment and staff available for free.Additionally, Dr Hannes Raath donated the money required to pay for Hadebe&#8217;s prosthesis. The hospital had needed funds to cover the anaesthetist fees as well as medication costs. This hurdle was overcome when the Nelspruit Anaesthetists Association offered to do the procedure for free.
