MBOMBELA &#8211; The store, which was established in 1971, is a South African family-owned business, which has become a franchise with branches all over the country. They all host an annual sale from January 27 to February 5.&#8220;We don&#8217;t usually do sales. This is a high-end, high-quality furniture-manufacturing business. We only have this one sale, every year around this time,&#8221; said Mbombela branch manager, Lara Laurenz.Some of the items are at a 75 per cent discount, and customers have been coming and going since the store opened on Friday.&#8220;You may want a couch, but you don&#8217;t know whether it will fit in your house. We can make that couch, with the same design, according to the specifications of your home. We will make it fit perfectly,&#8221; said Laurenz.This reputable business has renovated hotels and restaurants internationally and boasts exceptionally skilled staff. &#8220;Some of the original furniture-manufacturing employees are still making our products, over 40 years since the company was started,&#8221; Laurenz noted.
