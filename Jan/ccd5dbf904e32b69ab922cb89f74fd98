MBOMBELA &#8211; An educational specialist says pupils are being let down by the education system, as almost half of grade 10 pupils do not make it to matric.The country celebrated an increased national matric pass rate of 72,5 per cent in 2016 (compared to 2015&#8217;s 70,7 per cent), but Prof Ruksana Osman, dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of the Witwatersrand, said the aggregate approach skewed the picture and failed to show the many students who were let down by the education system.The danger with percentages and looking only at final outcomes is that it hides a picture of what is not working in the education system, she told Lowvelder.&#8220;It skews our knowledge and understanding of the health of the system. It prevents a holistic and genuine response and intervention to the troublesome spots in the education system.&#8221;The Mpumalanga Department of Education targeted a 10 per cent improvement, from its 78,6 per cent in 2015, but instead saw only 77,1 per cent of the grade 12 class of 2016 pass.The DA has raised questions about the pupils who failed to progress to grade 12.MP, Mr Gavin Davis, obtained information about learner numbers from the Department of Basic Education, which showed that 1 100 877 pupils enrolled for grade 10 in 2014, but only 610 178 wrote grade 12 in 2016.Mpumalanga&#8217;s figures show that of the 94 528 pupils who registered for grade 10 in 2014, only 54 251 wrote matric examinations in 2016. Therefore 40 277 puils went &#8220;missing&#8221; between grade 10 and 12.Davis called this a high &#8220;dropout rate,&#8221; leading to speculation that some pupils might have been &#8220;culled&#8221; to inflate the pass rate.He said the &#8220;true&#8221; matric pass rate could be only 40,2 per cent if weaker pupils who might have been removed from the system are counted. The basic education department said it was well aware of the situation regarding pupils&#8217; dropout rates.It said the reality is that it loses approximately 30 per cent of learners between grade 10 and 12.&#8220;The reasons are social-economic issues, youth criminality, substance abuse, teenage pregnancy, death, attending alternative education institutions, employment, as well as dropping out due to the frustration of continued grade repetition.As a result, we have put a number of interventions in place to counter these. The most bold is the progression policy, which is the exact opposite of the DA&#8217;s ridiculous assertions,&#8221; the department said in a statement.Spokesman for education in the province, Mr Jasper Zwane, didn&#8217;t respond to Lowvelder&#8217;s questions about what had happened to the 40 277 grade 10s who did not enrol for grade 12.Osman said principals can influence which subjects will be offered and which will not.&#8220;In other words, to avoid a huge failure rate in mathematics, they can encourage students to take mathematical literacy.&#8221;According to the national press, Umalusi&#8217;s records show the average for mathematics was 30,8 per cent, 37 per cent for maths literacy, 38 per cent for accounting, 39 per cent for geography and 44 per cent for history.The provincial Department of Education has established a mathematics, sciences and technology academy as a lever to improve the performance of pupils in these subjects to help position competitiveness nationally and internationally.More than 1 000 mathematics and physical sciences teachers who receive training on subject content and as well as facilitation skills using e-resources.Osman said this kind of intervention is a good one, especially when the development of teachers is seen as a long- term intervention and not a quick skill upgrade.
