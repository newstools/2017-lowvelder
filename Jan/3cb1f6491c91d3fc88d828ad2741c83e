The people need food and want to produce their own food,&#8221; he described the current situation in the neighbouring state.He added that a lot of conflict in the country came from opportunistic robbers who commit crime in the guise of being Renamo rebels.When Van Zyl retired from the police with the rank of colonel in 1995, he left behind a legacy as a peacemaker between South Africa and Mozambique with the series of joint military operations called Operation Rachel. These rid Mozambique of the tons of illegal weapons of war and military explosives, cached all over the country.Mr Van Zyl&#8217;s historical meeting with Tuareg nomads in 2011 in MaliThe &#8220;peacemaker&#8221; also faced his share of controversy when he was accused during the stormy 1990s as being part of a conspiracy to assassinate the former premier of Mpumalanga, Dr Mathews Phosa, and the late Mr Steve Mabona. Since 1996, Van Zyl has worked as a peace negotiator, security officer and explosive expert in conflict areas of Africa like Tanzania, Uganda and Mali.His expertise were in particular in demand after the bloody terrorist attacks on the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.His excellent team of informants on both sides of the border of Mozambique and South Africa from the days of the struggle between the ANC and the old nationalist government came in handy when the two countries embarked on Operation Rachel in 1995.World Vision&#8217;s current famine relief operation in Mozambique.Massive arms caches were identified in Mozambique and once a year an expert team of the SAPS Special Task Force and their Mozambican counterparts worked closely with Van Zyl in finding the caches and destroying the armament and explosives.There were 11 Operation Rachels and the teams consisted of the Special Task Force, Bomb Disposal Unit, Firearms Investigation Unit and Organised Crime Unit.&#8220;Our aim was to find all those arms caches that belonged to the ANC and Inkatha, which were used in the bloody conflicts in KwaZulu-Natal as well as those used by the poachers and Frelimo and Renamo during the civil war in the country,&#8221; he told Lowvelder.When he is at home in Mbombela he helps his wife Rina at their top-rated guest house, Beetleloop.
