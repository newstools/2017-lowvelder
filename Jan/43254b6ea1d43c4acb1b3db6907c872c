MBOMBELA &#8211; Time and place played major roles in involving author and journalist, Bridget Hilton-Barber in the apartheid struggle.&#8220;I have been walking around with this story in my head for the past two decades,&#8221; she said about her latest offering, Student Comrade Prisoner Spy.&#8220;What prompted me to get down and write it was an horrific accident I saw that triggered a flashback to an apartheid atrocity I had witnessed all those years ago. I realised I hadn&#8217;t processed a lot of the trauma from the 1980s, and it was now or never.&#8221;&nbsp;Don&#8217;t forget to RSVP for our Pen In My Hand event that takes place on Thursday, January 26.
