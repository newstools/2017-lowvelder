SKUKUZA- Gospel singer from White River, Eloise Saayman, was surprised but soon in stitches when earlier in January she came across two baby elephants in the Kruger National Park having a fight over who is the rightful owner of an ant-hill.&#8220;It was as if the one protecting his property was saying &#8216;this is my ant-hill. Get lost!&#8217;,&#8221; laughed Saayman.Watch more ellies playfully fighting! Cute overload!
