MBOMBELA &#8211; Police came under fire from the public about what they deemed to be a lack of response against the illegal use of fireworks over the festive season. There was an outcry on social media about fireworks causing extreme trauma to animals on New Year&#8217;s Eve.This follows an SPCA Barberton post on Facebook &#8211; a picture of a dog that was impaled on a fence. Another post surfaced, that of a dog run over in Steiltes. This resulted in a fury of comments regarding the lack of police presence in Nelsville to curb this same issue.Mbombela station commander, Brig Gerrie Agenbach, said the police together with municipality by-law officers, members of the bomb disposal unit and the Community Policing Forum, raided stores selling fireworks on the Friday and Saturday in an effort to curb the problem.&#8220;We issued fines and warnings, and seized fireworks from various shops and street vendors in the city.&#8221;Agenbach said the public should take into consideration that the loca SAPS also had to combat more serious crimes during this period.&#8220;Our main priority is offences such as farm attacks, hijackings and murders. Our successful operations kept unlawful acts to a minimum, and the people safe. This should be remembered by the public.&#8221;He said the police were also saddened to hear about the animals that suffered, and that a team effort is required to stop the use of fireworks. &#8220;We all should be working together to prevent the illegal use of fireworks to ensure they are only used in designated areas,&#8221; he said.Agenbach added that the police and the community now have an entire year to devise a plan to help curb this problem.According to SPCA White River chairman, Ms Estelle de Villiers, they took to the streets on New Year&#8217;s Eve with the police.&#8221;The officers accompanied us as a form of backup while we roamed the streets to try and help all the animals that had run away.&#8221; De Villiers said they had no reports of any deaths in the area and managed to reunite owners with their lost pets.Ms Gayle Smythe praised SPCA Nelspruit. &#8220;I would like to commend the two young ladies from the SPCA who arrived within minutes of being called to Marula Street regarding an extremely distressed dog that arrived at a function I was attending.&#8221; Smythe added that they were quick, efficient, gentle and caring.She had hoped the owners cared enough to collect the ridgeback.The social-media outcry was not only in South Africa, members of the public in Britain also complained on Facebook about the lack of support by London police to stop fireworks. Mr Mark Hatch, a resident, stated that fireworks had blasted off in the city from 21:00 until 02:00 also causing trauma to his pets.ACS Security Operations manager,Mr Hennie Potgieter, said they had added two more vehicles on the road to monitor the situation. &#8220;We had no authority to arrest people or hand out fines, but we did approach houses that we saw were using fireworks and asked them to stop,&#8221; Potgieter said. Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit response manager, Mr Callum MacPherson, said on New Year&#8217;s Day they received many calls regarding fireworks.&#8220;Unfortunately, we as a private security provider have no authority to act on municipal by-laws.&#8221;He said they did, however, try to talk to some of the offenders but a large number of them were under the influence and knew the officers did not have the authority to stop them.&#8220;Before new year&#8217;s we used social-media platforms to try and curb the illegal use of fireworks.&#8221;He concluded by saying they also shared a petition of banning fireworks on their Facebook page and believed that the majority of the city should support the drive.&nbsp;
