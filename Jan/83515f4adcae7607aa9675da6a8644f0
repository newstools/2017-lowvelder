MBOMBELA &#8211; Members of the public took to social media to voice their frustrations and concerns after Eskom published a Final Decision Notice that stated that, Eskom may, upon 15 calendar days, disconnect the electricity entirely and indefinitely, should the electricity debt situation not improve.&#8221;Here are some of the comments made by members of the public, as they appear on social media: Andre Janse van Rensburg &#8211; Hoekom ek betaal dan my krag. Ry saans by hulle kantore verby dan brand elke vervlakste lig. Julle vat ons geld dan moet ons in ongerief bly. Ek raak die &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;in Elize Delport &#8211; Things will have to fall apart completely before competent , skilled and dedicated people from a different party will take over and do things properly! Kathleen Bishop &#8211; I have heard it is illegal to cut off the electricity of PAYING customers- perhaps it is time to toi toi!!! Phiwinhlanhla Nkosi &#8211; To be honest I would love to see us taking to the streets to demand better treatment from Mbombela but we too busy Pippa Botha &#8211; Eskom went to the highest court in the land and received permission to cut off Municipalities that don&#8217;t pay. This is why they are only restricting the hours Dave Walters &#8211; While we may be paying the municipalities, the municipalities, who buy the bulk electricity from ESKOM, haven&#8217;t paid them. So, from ESKOM&#8217;s point of view, we aren&#8217;t their customers, the municipalities are. At least that&#8217;s how I understand it. Helps me sleep at night. Elaine Faure &#8211; Dark Dark South Africa. Petrus Fourie &#8211; This tactic by ESKOM is typical of the state we live in and the BULLYING TACTICS we see all over. Lets ask the question about time that they want to cut power; Its early morning when EVERYBODY THAT PAYS THERE BILLS, has to get up &#8211; prepare KIDS for school and get to work, PEAK TRAFFIC&#8230;. I dont have to explain more do I, WHO REALLY GETS AFFECTED??? The fat cats at the council in their shiny expensive cars that we the taxpayers are paying for or the real masses out here? Power off when we get home ( eventually)&#8230;.. WHAT EFFECT WILL THIS HAVE ON WHO??? The damages caused by these interruptions ripples out further just thinking about small refrigertors and other residential equipment that will have damages because of these spikes when power is interrupted and switched on&#8230;. YES I THINK A GENERAL REVOLUTION SHOULD BE EFFECTIVE to get rid of these pathetic council control and even the bigger service suppliers taking their millions worth of bonuses every year&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. push us the public out here a little more and I guess you re going to get what you re asking for! James Thrush &#8211; We have made some well placed calls. There appears to be merit in the final notice, so no it is not a hoax. However we were assured that it will not occur. Seemingly a stay of execution was negotiated. Thea Rix &#8211; Forwarded as recieved : Hi everyone just came back from meeting with the mayor ,he says that the electricity cuts will not happen, they have made an arrangement with eskom yesterday so please don&#8217;t stress ,we will monitor every payment . Walter Cronje &#8211; Ek breek hul plek af. As ek betaal vir krag dan soek ek krag om te gebruik. Adel Bruwer Botes &#8211; Jip want hulle is baie vinnig om ons krag af te sit as jy nie vinnig genoeg betaal nie Liezel Olivier &#8211; So wat maak hulle met die geld wat ons hulle betaal? Bianca Karsten &#8211; Ja vra dit daar is soveel &#8220;deals&#8221; if you read between the lines Jenny Wilson &#8211; Time and time again i wonder why dont we just make our payments directly to Eskom? Julie Edwards &#8211; Witbank sn word die 23ste afgesit en op beurtkrag dit is ERG !!Read more:
