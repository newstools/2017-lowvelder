MBOMBELA &#8211; The ruling party in Mpumalanga&#8217;s regional conference is to take place before March.Provincial secretary, Mr Mandla Ndlovu, said the regional conference was brought forward, in order to &#8220;focus on the policy conference in June&#8221; ahead of the national elective conference in December.&#8220;Nominations for the regional leaderships open in the first week of February, and the conference will take place before the end of next month,&#8221; he said.Elsewhere, the SACP and women&#8217;s league have thrown down the gauntlet in the ANC&#8217;s leadership election.SACP deputy secretary, Mr Solly Mapaila, called on the so-called &#8220;premier league&#8221; to be disbanded on Friday, ahead of the ruling party&#8217;s 105th birthday celebration at Orlando Stadium in Soweto on Sunday.Mpumalanga chairman and the premier, Mr David Mabuza is regarded as being a part of the &#8220;league&#8221; along with the Free State&#8217;s Mr Ace Magashule and North West&#8217;s Mr Supra Mahumapelo.It is believed that the &#8220;league&#8221; is lobbying to attain top positions on the ANC&#8217;s national executive committee (NEC) during the elective conference, scheduled for December.A large number of ANC supporters were bused in from Mpumalanga to the celebrations in a packed stadium, where outgoing president, Mr Jacob Zuma, gave the January address.He asked party structures to focus on the qualities of prospective candidates, before bandying about specific names for positions.Party secretary-general Mr Gwede Mantashe berated the women&#8217;s league for openly endorsing Ms Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, party veteran and outgoing African Union Commission chairman as its candidate for president, adding it made it harder for the party leadership to maintain discipline among branches.ANC chairman, Ms Baleke Mbete, agreed that the endorsement was premature, saying there was no obvious reason why only Dlamini-Zuma and deputy president Mr Cyril Ramaphosa should be in the running for the top position.Mabuza has said that he would lead, should the party call upon him to do so.Mpumalanga&#8217;s Bohlabela branch was also awarded the Sol Plaatje Award for the best branch in the country over the weekend.
