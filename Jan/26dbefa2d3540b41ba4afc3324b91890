It has recently come to Statistics South Africa s attention that individuals posing as Stats SA officials have been calling people, asking for their personal information such as identity numbers.Stats SA does not request identity numbers from respondents when conducting surveys. Whereas we may use telephone interviews to collect information for some business surveys, Stats SA does not conduct household-based surveys over the phone.Everyone is urged not to divulge any personal information to anyone claiming to be to a Stats SA representative over the phone. All Stats SA fieldworkers carry identification cards. &#8220;To verify the identity of a Stats SA fieldworker, contact our call centre on 012 310 8600.&#8221;Ends.Issued by Statistics South AfricaAlso read: Mpumalanga Crime Stats
