MBOMBELA &#8211; National chairman, Ms Baleka Mbete, told a capacity crowd at Mbombela Stadium on Sunday that a selfless leader was needed to unite the movement in this most important year.The ANC&#8217;s 106th year has been dubbed &#8220;The year of OR Tambo (who would have been 100 years old in October): unity in action.&#8221;Mbete has intimated that, like Mr Cyril Ramaphosa and Ms Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, she too is available for the position of president. In keeping with the decree by the national executive committee (NEC) to not name names before the succession debate has been opened, Mbete stuck to vague statements about leaders past and present in her address at the ANC Mpumalanga&#8217;s January 8 statement celebrations.She also attended the fund-raising gala on the Saturday, where she lauded the province&#8217;s leadership for bringing unity to the party and tripartite alliance.SACP provincial secretary, Mr Bonakele Majuba joined ANC chairman, Mr David Mabuza on stage in a show of unity after the two parties&#8217; supporters engaged in a bloody street brawl two years ago. Mabuza also announced the return to the fold ofMr Ronald Lamola, who left the party after the suspension of Mr Julius Malema. Over the two days both chairmen spoke extensively on unity. &#8220;You have been exemplary and must continue to be exemplary,&#8221; Mbete said.She cited a demonstrated track record in uniting the masses as a key quality required by the next leader.&#8220;Anyone who divides us is not worthy of the name &#8216;leader&#8217;. We must accept we have made mistakes in the past and we shall correct them. We must have in-depth discussions on the principles and qualities needed before discussing names.&#8220;During the elections, people told us we are too busy fighting each other to pay attention to their needs.&#8220;They don&#8217;t like our apparent preoccupation with our own personal gains. Are we really ready to kill each other at that conference, or show that we meant our seriousness about unity?&#8221; she stated.Mabuza agreed. &#8220;Those who left and got lost, there must be no gatekeepers to them to come back, then that cloud that fell on us will pass,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The spirit of working for unity in Mpumalanga must remain here, even if guys like me are no longer here,&#8221; he said.Mr Vusi Shongwe, Ms Baleka Mbete and Mr David Mabuza.
