MBOMBELA &#8211; The City of Mbombela Local Municipality owes Eskom R70 million.Mr Steve Schormann, opposition DA caucus leader in the municipality, said it was money Mbombela had counted on receiving, but didn t.National Treasury paid them approximately R50 million less than expected, as a part of their equitable share, and they received R20 million less than expected from consumers in December.Schormann added that Eskom s agreements with municipalities are unfair. Contrary to Municipal Finance Management Act stipulations, which allow a 30-day payment period for municipalities, CMLM is billed on the 30th of each month, and expected to pay by the 15th of the next. After that, putative interest is charged. How can Mbombela bill people and pay in that time? It is a bad contract and Eskom is not looking to solve the problem. They are making money for jam, he said.The municipality is expected to try to renegotiate the payment terms of its contract with Eskom. There are also proposals to sharpen credit control measures and introduce automated collections.He added that Mbombela and the former Umjindi have applied to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to use alternative suppliers, and CMLM is actively looking for alternatives.The municipality could not be reached for comment.
