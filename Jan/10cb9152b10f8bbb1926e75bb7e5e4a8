WHITE RIVER &#8211; For the second time in less than six months, the leader of the EFF, Mr Collen Sedibe, was taken into custody for public violence-related charges.Sedibe, along with EFF councillor Mr Cyril Chuene, was arrested following Sunday morning&#8217;s planned land invasion in the White River/Hillsview area.Numerous supporters protested during their appearance in White River Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Monday morning. They shouted with joy when Sedibe and Chuene were released on R500 bail each.Sedibe addressed supporters and said that their arrest does not scare them.&#8220;The point isn&#8217;t to invade land, but to occupy unoccupied land belonging to the government,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The arrest of the duo emanates from a Facebook message that made rounds calling people from certain areas in the White River precinct to occupy land belonging to Mbombela municipality,&#8221; said police spokesman Brig Leonard Hlathi.&#8220;The EFF Mpumalanga provincial command team calls on all people of Hillsview, Dwaleni, Mbonisweni, KaBokweni, Mganduzeni, Jerusalema, Chweni and surrounding farms to a land occupation programme which will take place between White River and Hillsview from 08:00,&#8221; Sedibe stated on Thursday. He further encouraged those who need land to build their houses next to town, and to come in numbers.&#8220;It&#8217;s high time that people stay closer to the towns, as they cannot afford to buy the houses from the whites who still own the town,&#8221; he said.The call to occupation had land owners in the area worried about the recourse available to them. However, the police was placed on high alert to prevent an unlawful occupation.Hundreds of EFF supporters carrying spades and pangas flocked to the Old Plaston Road to claim their piece of land. When the group arrived, they were calm, despite pouring rain. As the day progressed, they became increasingly fidgety. &#8220;We are suffering,&#8221; one community member told the newspaper.He stated that the land had apparently been bought by the South African government ten years ago. &#8220;They paid R42 million for it,&#8221; the man said. &#8220;We want it now.&#8221; He added that the group had been fighting for rights to the land for the past decade.The land, which borders an unnamed local road between the R536 and R538, was closed off by the SAPS as a precautionary measure. Tear gas was apparently used at one stage to disperse some of the smaller groups. The police presence was condemned by Sedibe. &#8220;There was no complaint that could justify the police&#8217;s presence,&#8221; he told Lowvelder.The City of Mbombela Local Municipality opened a criminal case at Nelspruit Police Station.&#8220;When analysed, the message bears connotations of criminal elements,&#8221; Hlathi said. He explained that as a result of the case, as well as the alleged actions by the political party leader, the police were bound to act by making the arrests. The crowd dispersed without staking their claims.Sedibe and Chuene appeared in court yesterday, on charges of trespassing, incitement to public violence, and a charge depicted under the Gatherings Act. The case was postponed to February 20.EFF leader, Mr Julius Malema, has called for the forced occupation of land. &#8220;On the April 6 all branches of the EFF will partake in land occupation struggles. These struggles highlight the urgent need for this country to resolve the land question by expropriating land without compensation for equal redistribution,&#8221; an EFF statement recently declared. &#8220;If you see any beautiful piece of land and you like it, occupy it, it belongs to you,&#8221; Malema recently told supporters, in front of the Bloemfontein Magistrate&#8217;s Court, where he appeared to face charges of inciting members to occupy land.Also read: PHOTOS of the land the EFF seeks to invade. The Freedom Front responded by saying that Malema is playing with fire. &#8220;It disturbs relationships in SA and has the potential for an anarchy that SA can not afford,&#8221; said the party leader Mr Pieter Groenewald.Also read: SAPS deployed at EFF land invasion. &#8220;Nowhere does our Constitution allow for grabbing land without compensation. Even the Expropriation Bill, which has not yet been signed off by the president, allows for compensation for land required by the state,&#8221; said DA parliamentarian Mr Ken Robertson. &#8220;Once people start acting outside the boundaries of our Constitution, it means that the rule of law is being violated,&#8221; he added.
