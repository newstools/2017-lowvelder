WHITE RIVER &#8211; One of South Africa&#8217;s greatest artists of the past decades has died at her farm in the Lowveld. Renowned and well-respected Judith Mason died on December 29 in her house in Heidelberg, just outside of White River. This has brought an end to an locally and internationally acclaimed career, spanning more than 50 years since her first solo exhibition. Over the years she lived on and off in the Lowveld, together with her daughter Tamara and son-in-law, Mark Attwood &#8211; who runs the highly regarded Artists Press Art Studio on their farm in the Brondal area. In recent times, she was more permanently based here and spent the past December in the care of friends when she apparently succumbed to a sudden heart attack.
