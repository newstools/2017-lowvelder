MBOMBELA &#8211; Mr Mmusi Maimane has wished South Africans a 2017 &#8220;that comes with positive change that contributes to personal and societal advancement.&#8221;&#8220;May the New Year bring with it a commitment to working towards building a growing an inclusive economy that guarantees job creation for the nine million jobless South Africans and those who join the ranks of jobseekers following the release of matric and higher education results.&#8220;In this regard, we call upon students and higher education institutions to work together in order to ensure a peaceful registration period at the country s campuses.&#8220;The year 2016 was a challenging year for us all making it vital for us all to reflect on it so that we do not repeat the same mistakes while working to find better solutions to our problems as a country.&#8220;The New Year, 2017, presents us with an opportunity to start afresh by recommitting to economic advancement, the rule of law, accountability, constitutionalism and Ubuntu.Maimane said he hoped 2017 may be the year reconciliation continued &#8220;and building a country that is united in its diversity.&#8220;Furthermore, I call upon South Africans to celebrate the New Year by abiding by the rules of the road and to celebrate responsibly May 2017 bring with it the positive changes that will ensure that we build a better South Africa for all,&#8221; he concluded.Similarly, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, MP and president of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), welcomed in 2017 with renewed hope, &#8220;eager to see changes in our country, our communities and in our own lives.&#8220;The year we leave behind was difficult and often frustrating, and many of us questioned whether anything could be done to change the worrying trajectory of South Africa.&#8220;But with the new year comes the opportunity to map a new course. This is the time to make a decision that will shape 2017. We are not helpless bystanders witnessing the downward spiral of the economy, politics and social cohesion. We are participants, with the power to influence what happens next.&#8220;With the state of our nation, not a single citizen can step back and claim that there is nothing they can do. It is only through a collective effort that we will put South Africa back on track towards fulfilling the promises of democracy.&#8220;This is the moment to make a fresh commitment. Before us lies immense opportunity. Are you willing to make a difference?&#8221; he concluded.
