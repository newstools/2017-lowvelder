The Sudwala Screaming Monster is a half-marathon. This isn’t an easy route. It involves a climb to the top of the pass and into the Sudwala Caves. It is mountain goat heaven. Just when you think you must be at the top, you go even further up, and when you run out of road, there’s still a little bit more steep climbing up to the cave itself.
An amazing treat waits for you at the top, though, as you get to
run inside the Sudwala cave,
entering the awe-inspiring space, which is millions of years old, at an altitude of around 200m. Accommodation is available at the finish venue, but hurry, as places run out fast.
Venue: Sabie Lodge
