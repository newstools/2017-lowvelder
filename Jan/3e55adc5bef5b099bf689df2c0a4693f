Apart from focusing on the theft and interference of data, the bill suggests criminalising so-called &#8220;malicious online conduct.&#8221; Examples include that a sentence of three years be prescribed for anyone found guilty of: Such conduct may lead to prosecution, even if the sender intended it to from part of a private conversation.
