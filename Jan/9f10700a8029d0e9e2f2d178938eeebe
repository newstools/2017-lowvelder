MBOMBELA &#8211; Dr Mathews Phosa should be the next president of the ANC, and the country, the party in Cape Town made heard on Sunday.According to Mr Andile Lily, a member of the Western Cape provincial executive council (PEC) and organisation Ses&#8217;khona People&#8217;s Rights Movement, the &#8220;untainted&#8221; former Mpumalanga premier has the right reputation for the job.&#8220;We are tired of defending our leaders, instead of focusing on the ANC&#8217;s programmes,&#8221; he told Lowvelder yesterday.Lily said a fearless leader was needed to bring about socio-economic transformation for the majority of the people, who are poor.&#8220;In the ANC, we elect leaders on the basis of their reputation. We want a leadership that is credible in society to save the party that has fallen into crisis.&#8221;According to Lily, Sunday&#8217;s meeting was between 23 ANC branches in Cape Town, but the decision was supported by the entire province.They want minister in the presidency Mr Jeff Radebe as deputy president as well as Mr Senzo Mchunu, Mr Paul Mashatile, Ms Thandi Modise and Dr Blade Nzimande in the top six.Lily added they loved the ANC dearly, and were tired of the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Alliance&#8221; running their province, but they were also tired of an arrogant leader who believes in factionalism.&#8220;We don&#8217;t want the ANC made of bags of money. It is destroying the movement and the country.&#8221;According to Lily, they considered supporting current deputy president Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, but decided against him over, among other things, his &#8220;reckless&#8221; dealing in kicking Mr Julius Malema out of the party, which led to the birth of the EFF, as well as issues related to Marikana.&#8220;We want an ANC that is united.&#8221; Lily confirmed that they had announced the decision without consulting Phosa.&#8220;We will have to go around the country and persuade leaders to support him. Phosa for president!&#8221; he concluded.Phosa told Lowvelder last year that &#8220;all options are on the table&#8221; in the leadership race. He declined to comment to the newspaper yesterday.
