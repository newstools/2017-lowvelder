She said it was unfortunate that the general public did not differentiate between the types of healers within the traditional healing sector.&#8220;Some might use human bones due to their calling but when you have been through initiation like myself you do not touch dead people&#8217;s parts because your duty is to heal and not harm.&#8221;&#8220;As traditional healers we are regulated by the South African Healers Association and we pride ourselves in good healing practices,&#8221; she said.A shroud used to wrap the bodies was found outside the graves.The Nelspruit Muslim Burial Services said it will strengthen security at the cemetery and ask the City of Mbombela Local Municipality to erect lights.Mpumalanga police spokesman, Sgt Gerald Sedibe, said the police are investigating a case of violation of graves.
