MBOMBELA &#8211; After a week that was, for most, time to get back to work, back to school and the back to general hustle and bustle of life after the holiday season, the Crossing SUPERSPAR team decided to treat commuters to a Wake Up Nelspruit coffee pack. Coffee-sachet packs containing chocolate and biscuits were handed out.The excitement was amplified by the setup of an outside broadcast of Radio Laeveld. Radio manager, Mr Robin Jansma, erected the outside broadcast on top of a platform, under a roof structure at the Baobab Circle at Crossing Centre.This gave him the advantage of viewing traffic and encouraging commuters to tune into 100.5 while en route to their destination.
