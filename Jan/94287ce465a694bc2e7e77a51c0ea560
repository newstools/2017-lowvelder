MBOMBELA &#8211; The two men of Bossies Community Justice (BCJ) had a busy festive season, with the team assisting in a number of rescue operations.BCJ&#8217;s Danie Theron said the first was on December 10 when a light aircraft crashed in the Ngodwana area. Theron is a qualified civil aviation crash scene investigator. &#8220;We received the call-out at around 16:00 on the Saturday.&#8221;He said they drove to the scene and did a search and assessment of the area the plane had crashed in. &#8220;It was on a steep incline and the weather was rainy and misty. Time was also against us as it was getting dark.&#8221;At an aircraft crash scene the Civil Aviation Authority has to give authorisation to remove the deceased at a crash scene. &#8220;We got permission, but decided it was getting too dark so we would do the retrievals the next day,&#8221; Theron said.The following day BCJ, Lowveld Off Road Rescue Unit and members of the police and forest marshals under the control of Pieter Knipshield, gathered at around 05:00. &#8220;K9 WO Andr Smit also came to help us on Saturday,&#8221; he stated. Theron said they teamed up and did another investigation of the scene. &#8220;We took photographs of the wreckage as well.&#8221; They had left police guarding the scene the night before. &#8220;We first put the deceased into body bags and loaded them onto stretchers,&#8221; he said. Theron explained that the bodies were then hauled out using rope systems. &#8220;The area was like an indigenous forest with plantations around it. Where the initial plane crashed into the mountain, it had fallen another 40 meters.&#8221;He believed the occupants of the plane must have perished on impact. On December 24 Theron assisted with the retrieval of a biker&#8217;s body. &#8220;The Triumph motorbike had gone down an embankment at Robbers Pass near Pilgrim&#8217;s Rest.&#8221; The following day at around 16:00, they received a call to come and assist with the rescue of five people who had been involved in an accident.&#8220;It was on the Barberton/Badplaas Road. Their vehicle had gone down a cliff.&#8221; He said as they arrived at the scene and while they were busy setting up, Albert Gryvenstein discovered a human skull on the side of the road. &#8220;The police took it for further investigation,&#8221; he said. Theron said ER24 emergency staff had already gone down the cliff with a fireman from Barberton. &#8220;I started setting up a hauling system and sent down another medic.&#8221;They went down with stretchers. &#8220;The first patient we lifted up who was seriously injured was an 11 year-old girl. She had a broken femur,&#8221; Theron said. After the third patient was hauled up the cliff, the rescue staff were exhausted, so the fourth time, ER24&#8217;s Hendrik van der Merwe went down to handle the stretcher. &#8220;He came up with the last patient who was a nine-year-old boy.&#8221; The rescue operation took approximately six hours.On January 1 at around 16:00, they received another call-out about an elderly woman who had slipped and fallen down a cliff near Mbuzini. &#8220;When we arrived we saw her sitting on a ledge halfway down the cliff edge,&#8221; he said. Theron explained that when they arrived, they were trying to rescue her from the top. Theron and Gavin Windgrave, an SAPS reservist, walked at the bottom of the cliff and found a path which led them to about six metres from where she was stuck. &#8220;She was badly dehydrated, as she had been stuck on the ledge for about two days,&#8221; Theron said. The first thing they did was give her water. &#8220;She was close to a small tree which we secured and then slung a harness around her.&#8221;Theron said a rescue worker went just above her and they slowly lowered her down. &#8220;She was taken to hospital by provincial ambulance service. She was dehydrated and had injured her right wrist and had a injury on the back of her head,&#8221; he concluded.Read more here : Bossie s Community Justice: the last two weeks
