KAAPMUIDEN &#8211; A concerned group of residents says it will not back down in its attempt to get the provincial government to fix the R38 between Barberton and Kaapmuiden.They had erected three warning signs, carrying the provincial Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport&#8217;s (DPWRT) logo, warning motorists about the poor state of the surface, in a bid to push authorities to fast-track repairs.The residents said the road is in desperate need of repair and resurfacing.Also read: Road users resort to unusual tactics The same day that Lowvelder&#8217;s sister publication, Barberton Times, reported on the road signs last Wednesday, government officials were seen removing them.Spokesman for DPWRT, Mr David Nkambule, said the department removed the signage because it was erected illegally.The road is narrow and mostly bordered by trees and grass. Its reserve is narrow or, in places, non-existent, which makes it difficult and dangerous for users to pull off. The surface is uneven and riddled with potholes for the first 10 kilometres.Also read: New road shows signs of damageThe residents allege that only a stretch of the road &#8211; from the house of the premier, Mr David Mabuza, in Barberton towards Johannesburg &#8211; has been fixed.The community members said their complaints have been met by the department with disdain.&#8220;Every time we approach they tell us stories, but nothing has been done. We don&#8217;t want to embarrass the government, but we are forced to act this way,&#8221; said one concerned community member, who chose to remain anonymous.Also read: Traffic accidents a violation of human rights &#8220;We are organising an even bigger board to be erected on the R40 in town. So that when the premier drives to his office, he can see that we are deeply concerned by the condition of the road,&#8221; he concluded.
