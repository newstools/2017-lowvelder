 MBOMBELA: A vehicle suspected to contain a stolen laptop and handbag was seen driving at excessive speeds through Mbombela at approximately 18:00 this evening. According to Callum McPherson of High Tech Security, Barberton High Tech reported that the suspected vehicle, a blue Toyota Venture was travelling in the direction of Mbombela. “Barberton SAPS tried to assist, but were unable to intervene and stop the three suspects. Nelspruit High Tech was contacted, along with the SAPS Flying Squad and gave chase,” said McPherson. The vehicle was chased to Kanyamazane, but was lost in traffic because according to McPherson, “the driver was driving like a maniac.” At this stage it cannot be confirmed whether an arrest was made, but two individuals who are suspected to have jumped from the vehicle were apprehended by the SAPS and taken to the Barberton Police station, according to Sakkie Dednam of High Tech Barberton. This is a developing story and Lowvelder will update as soon as more information is confirmed and made available. Read more: Man arrested after stolen car chase
