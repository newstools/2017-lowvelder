 MBOMBELA – Die Konsert Huiz took place for the first time on Thursday October 5. The brainchild of Natascha C, Henry-John Williams, Riaan Loubser and Karien van Niekerk, the event was an intimate performance platform for members of Mbombela’s cultural community to showcase their talents, and to view the talent of their peers. For an entrance fee of only R60 per person, guests enjoyed food and beverages while watching the concert. According to Loubser, this fee helped to cover some of the costs incurred by hosts Williams and Pieter Erasmus. This event featured the talented Natascha C, accompanied by the equally talented Williams on keyboard. The duo performed a production called My Taal. Natascha C said, “The production was a journey into my life, the nature of the language I speak, as well as my culture and heritage”. Loubser said, “The exact details for the next event are still to be confirmed. We wanted to see how the night went and to assess the feedback received. Based on the very positive feedback, I can confirm that there will most certainly be more events to come.” The next event will be in December, a Christmas cabaret. Enquiries: Loubser on 082-551-4140.
