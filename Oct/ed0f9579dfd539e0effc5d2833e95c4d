At the event, Pumulo urged all women to make use of these services saying: “As woman we need to test ourselves. Both breast and cervical cancer can be managed if they are detected while in their early stages.” Due to the rain, the course of the walk/run was limited to around the stadium. When asked about her reasons for participating, Pulumo said, “While I have not had family members who have had cancer, I do know of friends who had to watch theirs battle the disease. My participation in this fun run is dedicated to them who have had to go through this experience.”
