 MBOMBELA – The alleged Jock Pub & Grill shooter is a free man once again, after spending 48 hours in the custody of Correctional Services this week. Roston Grix is believed to be the man who fired a number of shots into the air in the bar’s parking area two weeks ago. Witnesses relayed that a fight started in the bar area, after which bouncers removed the troublemakers. Another fight broke out in the parking lot, and shots were fired.  He was arrested at his place of work on Monday and released on Wednesday. Spokesman for correctional services, Mesia Hlungwani, said Grix was detained pending an investigation into him possibly breaking the conditions of his parole. He had previously served time in prison for an unconfirmed crime and is currently out on parole.  Hlungwani said that obtaining statements from witnesses and people close to Grix formed part of the department’s investigations. At the time of going to press Hlungwani was awaiting the conclusions of the final report. He indicated that Grix would be facing appropriate sanctions should he be found guilty of violating the conditions of his parole.  Nelspruit police spokesman, Capt Dawie Pretorius said the police were investigating the matter.
