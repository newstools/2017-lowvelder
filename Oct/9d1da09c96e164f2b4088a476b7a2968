  If you wish to have the snake removed by a  trained professional it is important that you take note of this information. Handlers will only respond to immediate sightings and instances wherein the snake’s location is confirmed.  Different snakes require different methods of capture. Details about the snakes appearance can assist the handler in this regard.  All living creatures deserve a chance at life, snakes are no different.  Snakes that feel threatened may try to escape or strike to protect themselves.  If the snake feels that your dog or cat is getting too close it may strike in self-defence. If the snake is a spitting cobra, then your pets will be at risk of being blinded by its venom. This information was provided by Andrew Geldenhuys of Reptile Recovery in Mpumalanga.
