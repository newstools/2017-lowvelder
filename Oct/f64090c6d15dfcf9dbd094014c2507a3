The road to Orpen Gate was opened a while ago, but the road to Welverdiend is still closed. This follows an earlier notice by the management of the Kruger National Park (KNP) that it had been closed due to a strike at the Wildlife College in the Welverdiend area on the Orpen road (R531). There was supposed to be a meeting at the college at 10:00 today, but it did not start on time since the community refused to go inside the college and insisted on a new venue. SAPS members were present and monitored the situation.
