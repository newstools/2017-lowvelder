 MBOMBELA – Her mother, Verna Mulder, broke the news on the Facebook group, Please Pray for Mienke on Wednesday. An eye specialist visited the baby girl, who is currently undergoing rehabilitation at Netcare Rehabilitation Hospital in Auckland Park, Johannesburg where they performed phase one of a cortical visual impairment (CVI) test.  MRI scans showed that, as a result of her severe brain damage, she might not bee able to see and possibly walk and talk. Her parents were hopeful that former was not true. The test showed that, despite her ability to see, her brain, however, cannot interpret what she sees. This means that she cannot recognise her parents. “This is just phase one and I believe, with hard work along with the therapists, we can soon reach phase two,” said Mulder. “We are going to continue praying and believing that God will heal Mienke’s eyes and brain so that she can see,” she added.  Verna and Ryno are considering stem-cell transplantation. They are due to meet with the specialist on Thursday.
