BARBERTON â€“ An international group of geologists will hold a field workshop in town this week to discuss a proposed scientific drilling in the Makhonjwa Mountains.
This area is in the process of being declared a World Heritage Site due to its excellently preserved variety of rocks of great age as well of its importance and relevance to our knowledge of the history
of earth.
According to the leading geologists and academic working on these rock formations for many years, Prof Christoph Heubeck from the Friedrich Schiller University located in Jena, Thuringia, Germany, this scientific drilling will contribute to making available fresh, unweathered rock samples necessary for detailed analysis to further build up this knowledge.
This group will include 55 geoscientists from 14 countries.
