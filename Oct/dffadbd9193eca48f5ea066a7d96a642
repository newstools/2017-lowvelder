 MBOMBELA – Two accidents on a wet N4 claimed seven victims yesterday, among them three children. Both involved bakkies losing control and crashing into oncoming trucks. Joseph Mabuza, spokesman for the provincial Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, said the first accident occurred shortly after 17:00 between the Old Joe Monument and Old Joe’s Kaia on the Schoemanskloof Road. A bakkie, driving in the direction of Mbombela, apparently lost control and hit an oncoming truck. An adult male and two children were killed. An adult woman and two children were seriously injured, according to Mabuza. The crash caused heavy delays on the N4. The scene was cleared at about 21:30. In another accident late last night, another bakkie lost control and hit a truck between the Tenbosch turnoff and Marloth Park. Mabuza said that, of the bakkie’s five occupants, four were killed, among them a child.  In both cases the truck drivers were uninjured.
