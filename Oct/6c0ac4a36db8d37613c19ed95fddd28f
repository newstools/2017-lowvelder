Lowvelder readers stand a chance to win a Panarottis voucher to the value of R500. All you have to do is look for your hidden Old Joe in today’s printed edition, and if yours has a Lowveld Media stamp on it, you could be a winner! Don’t forget to bring along your Old Joe 90 map to prove that you are participating in the competition. We chose to go with the rhino theme, because living in the Lowveld, we are all very aware of the rhino anti-poaching projects and obviously we are all supporting this course. We are also promoting this awareness in our playground area.  Since the first Panarottis Pizza Pasta opened in Tygervalley, Cape Town in 1990, we’ve prepared our food the same way they do in Italy – with the freshest and finest quality ingredients, a good dash of Mediterranean flair, and loads of passion.  And just like they do in Italy, we serve up generous portions that are guaranteed to keep the whole famiglia happy. Best of all, our delicious food can be enjoyed in 79 warm, friendly Panarottis restaurants around South Africa and the world. Buon appetito!  We are currently running a “Pizza Bust” campaign, where Panarotties will surprise and treat you with pizzas and vouchers!  Nominate your school, business or community team and tell us why Panarottis Ilanga Mall should “Pizza Bust”you. We also present workshops where junior chefs (primary school children) can learn to make pizzas.  Please join us the next time you have to host a kiddies birthday party, we’ll make it exciting for them! Our Play area is manned by child minders who take care of your children while you can relax during your meal. Breakfast is served till 11:00. Gluten and wheat free pizzas are also available. We deliver in Nelspruit.  Visit Panarottis at i’langa Mall. You can also get in contact with them for bookings and deliveries on 013 742 2087.
