 MSHOLOZI – No arrests have been made after an eight-year-old boy was raped at Mama Esther’s Safe Haven early on Tuesday morning, despite the police believing that the suspect is known to the centre. According to Lebo Malope, chairman of the board of Mama Esther’s haven, the boy was dragged from the sleeping quarters and taken to the kitchen where he was raped by the man, believed to be 27 years old. After the incident the boy ran home to his mother, who lives not far from the centre. She was shocked to see his swollen face and injuries on his back and rushed him to hospital.  He is currently in her care. Malope said there are no alarms where the children sleep.  “We do not put alarms where there is possibility of movement, and only put them where there is not. That is how the man was able to move around undetected,” he said. The controversial centre, that houses 80 children, has come under fire from the Department of Social Development (DSD) for failing to adhere to its requirements in terms of housing. Earlier this year the department attempted to remove some of the children due to the centre’s non-compliance. However, Mama Esther Nkosi has said that as long as the children need her, she will not turn any away.  It is not clear why the boy was sleeping at the centre on the night. According to police spokesman, Sgt Cynthia Mbokodo, police are investigating.
