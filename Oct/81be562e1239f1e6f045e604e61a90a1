 MBOMBELA – Youths from the University of Mpumalanga debated their heritage when Brand South Africa hosted a students’ dialogue on the role of the youth in preserving constitutionalism and promoting freedom of speech, on Friday. The event at the Protea Hotel featured student leaders and sought to discover what about the Constitution inspired them, as well as steps they would take to promote constitutionalism in their organisations.  “We have done various campaigns to educate people on the Constitution,” said Toni Gumede, Brand South Africa’s strategic relationship manager for government. “This is the first time that we have done this in the province.”
According to Gumede, the university was chosen because it was still young.  “This puts its students in a unique position in that they can define the culture they choose to lead.” The debate was robust with many of the student leaders arguing that the Constitution was difficult to understand and not easily accessible.
To steer clear of the youth’s apathy in engaging with South Africa’s Constitution, panellist Veli Mashaba called for a bridging in the gap between what is written and people’s daily experiences.  “When we know when to apply it to general life it becomes natural to understand and live with it,” said Mashaba.”Our education system needs to be reviewed to build a sense of pride in our country and a better understanding of it,” said Sophie Kanza of the Sophie A Kanza Foundation.  Considering the success of the event, Gumede said that Brand South Africa hoped to return at a later date and challenge the students further in various discussions.
