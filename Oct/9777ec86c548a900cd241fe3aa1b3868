Park management hence cautions visitors to take the necessary precautionary measures, like using prophylaxes or vaccinations and to avoid exposing the skin whilst outside in the evenings. Communications and marketing general manager William Mabasa says the active malaria season started in October, with March and April the highest risk periods. “Visitors who contract malaria after visiting the park should immediately report it to our doctors in Skukuza to assist the recording and identifying of affected areas.” He also advised visitors to consult resident medical doctors in Skukuza for information and advice prior to their visit to the Park.
