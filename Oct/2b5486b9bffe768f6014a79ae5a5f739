 MBOMBELA – Weeks after construction of the Friedenheim Road ceased due to non-payment of the contractors by the municipality, work resumed on the site on Monday. The contractors have been closing sections of the road, which is being rebuilt and widened to four lanes, since May. Currently, the third and final phase between Kragbron and Suikerriet streets is under way. It was supposed to be completed by the end of next month. Willem Venter, from Master Turf, was furious when the work on the road, on which his business is situated, stopped. Not only did the dust coat and damage the machinery he sells, but regular clients could not access his store. Municipal spokesman, Joseph Ngala said the contractor and consulting engineers had been paid all outstanding invoices, and that AECOM had been back on site since Friday with work resuming in all earnest on Monday. “The road between Samora Machel and Kragbron was primed and ready to be sealed,” he added. “The contractor is busy with the layer work on the section between Kragbron and Suikerriet streets.” Ngala did not explain why the contractors were not paid or how much they were owed.
