SKUKUZA – Graeme Mitchley recently encountered this leopard with his porcupine kill on the H10 near the S32 Orpen Dam Road in the Kruger National Park.
He waited for three hours while the leopard slept in a tree near the road before eventually emerging from its hiding and heading for its kill.
Getting to the tasty bits must have been quite difficult as it had to get rid of the quills, and after about half an hour two hyenas added to the leopard’s agony when they forced it higher into the tree.
“It now had to literally climb on top of the porcupine and looked terribly uncomfortable,” Mitchley said. “In that awkward position it carried on eating while the hyenas patiently waited below.”
Except for growling at them occasionally, the leopard was more interested in finishing his meal without having to share it.
Unfortunately, Mitchley had to get back to camp and did not see how things ended. He came to the conclusion that porcupine meat must taste absolutely wonderful, “otherwise why would a leopard catch it!”
