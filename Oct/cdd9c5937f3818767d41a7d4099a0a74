MBOMBELA – Lowveld High School  grade 12s showed up and showed out at their matric dance on Thursday. The glamorous event was held at Mbombela Stadium under the theme: A Street in Paris.  A suite, specially decked out for the pupils, had been transformed into a fancy, sophisticated Parisian street surrounded by boutiques.  The learners got to live it up being catered to by their grade 11 counterparts. But not before walking the red carpet downstairs where they were cheered on by friends and family.
