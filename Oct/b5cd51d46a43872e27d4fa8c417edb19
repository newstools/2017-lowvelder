 MBOMBELA – The sales representative for Lowveld Media said the news that she had won the competition came as a surprise last Friday after a hectic day. “I was about to knock off when I received the call – I couldn’t believe it. I had to ask numerous times if it was really true. I remember asking for an email just to be sure,” she said. The 24-year-old writer and performer of poetry divulged that she is not a model but loves taking photographs with a friend of hers who happens to be a photographer.  She used to take part in beauty pageants, but stopped entering. “The last pageant I entered was Miss Mamelodi Sundowns.This was simply because I realised how competitions can be frustrating and how they can break you as a person. In beauty pageants you compete with a lot of beautiful girls and at the end of the day when you do not win, you sometimes questioning whether you are beautiful enough. “I decided I would not stand in front of an audience and judges and let them define who I am, how beautiful I am and to what extent, hence I stopped.” Thabang Mashile.

One of her favourite quotes she lives by is, “Live as though you already are, so when the time comes for you to become, you will flourish for you would’ve long been what you set out to be”. She is a lover of art and believes in using poetry as a tool to address social issues, and as a means for social change. She is also grateful to her family for the enormous support, especially her sister-in-law Unathi Mashile who she described as her pillar and number one fan. Her prizes include appearing in the retailer’s summer advertising campaign, R50 000 cash, a R2 000 Legit gift card per month for 12 months, as well as a R500 health spa voucher per month for 12 months. Thabang Mashile is the new ‘it girl’ in town.
