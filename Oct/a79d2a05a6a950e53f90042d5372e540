 MBOMBELA – Hoërskool Bergvlam recently sent off its matrics in style at Emnotweni. It gave matriculants one last opportunity to socialise before starting with final exams. The pupils were welcomed in lavish style, with the presence of each couple or individual being announced as they arrived. Each couple or individual then ascended onto a runway with overhanging fairy lights.They then progressed to a red carpet, and into the arena after having their photo taken at the end of the runway. According to Erasmus, the theme for this year’s farewell was “industrial”.

Erasmus explained: “The event was free of charge for the matriculants. The money was raised by the different fund-raising events hosted by the grade 11s throughout the year. This included events like the Colour Fun as well as various school dances.” The learners were treated to a three-course meal provided by the arena.After the starters,Ndumiso Twala and Charlize Greyling handed out various awards to their peers. The main course was then served,followed by some announcements by head boy and head girl, Tristan Louw and Noni Mabuza (pictured here). The dance floor was then opened for the matrics to party the night away. Noni told Lowvelder that her final year of school has been a special one. “I will always remember the unity that existed within our class. Even when we felt divided, we always found a way to bounce back during the difficult times we experienced throughout the year.” Tristan shared some advice for next year’s grade 12s. “Never let anyone dictate to you the path you must take. Stay true to yourself and always follow your dreams.”
