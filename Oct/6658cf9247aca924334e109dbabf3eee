 MBOMBELA – Mandy Mhlongo, a grade 11 learner from Hoërskool Bergvlam is the provincial winner of the National Tourism Career Expo (NTCE). She will go on to represent the province at the national expo, later this month in the Free State. The platform is to help expose learners to tourism career options. Speaking under the theme, Tourism Alive with Opportunities, Mandy had one minute to prepare a speech which she delivered at Lowveld High School. She later had a a three-minute question-and-answer session.  The competition is presented by the national Department of Tourism, in partnership with the Culture, Arts, Tourism, Hospitality and Sport Education and Training Authority (CATHSSETA) and Department of Economic, Small Business Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs (DESTEA).  The aim of the competition is to see whether learners have the ability do their research, as well as sharpen their communication skills while improving their research capabilities, which is what is needed in the tourism industry.
