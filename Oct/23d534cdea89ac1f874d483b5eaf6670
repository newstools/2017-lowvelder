 NAAS – On Sunday September 24, Provincial Premier David Mabuza once again visited the disgruntled community that shut down KaMaqhekeza and Nkomazi Plaza shopping centres, blockaded the surrounding roads and disrupted transport for a week.  On Monday September 18 he also addressed residents in an attempt to calm the situation. At the time they agreed to end the strike and the  disruptions which had started the previous Monday.  Violence escalated that Wednesday. Police fired rubber bullets to disperse protesters and several people were reportedly arrested. The protests continued until Monday September 18 when residents demanded to speak to the top officials. Residents crowded into KaMaqhekeza Stadium to hear how the premier planned to address issues such as the lack of potable water, demands for tar roads and corrupt councillors.”Let kids go to school and those who are working go to work. I have come here and will solve the issues with you. This is my job,” Mabuza said. “I’m not happy if you stand up and are crying for water, because it is life.” Residents told the premier that they were being mistreated by a local councillor, and alleged that he attacked a Naas resident in his home, which resulted in the resident’s hospitalisation. They feared more people would be attacked if the councillor was not removed from office. Mabuza pledged that he would investigate and fire the councillor if he was found guilty of the claims.  Another meeting was arranged for Thursday September 21, in which officials from both the municipality and the premier’s office would give feedback on how the community’s issues would be addressed. It was postponed.  On Sunday September 24 Nkomazi mayor, Cllr Thulisile Khoza accompanied Mabuza to the meeting. The crowd chanted, “The mayor must fall”. Mabuza reiterated his plea that the community not return to closing the roads. “We will not solve the issue by fighting,” he said.
