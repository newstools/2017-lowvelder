 MBOMBELA – The community came out in their numbers last Thursday to support the good work being done by Huis Betlehem. The organisation desperately needs funds to continue operating  in the area.  There are two houses, one in Mbombela and one in White River. Currently they can only afford to use the one in White River, where nine children are being cared for. Werner Terblanche of J&M Security and Jarrod Powell, owner of The Exterminator Pest Control Services. MC and supporter, Melany van der Merwe, explained they wanted to spread awareness of the existence of Huis Betlehem and the work they do. “By holding this golf day we hope to get people who can pledge to help monthly. We are making an urgent appeal to locals to assist with funding.” For a cost of R1 000, companies and members of the public could put together a four-ball to play the full 18 holes. Additional money was also raised by the co-founders of Angel Fudge, Ann and Elsa Scheepers, who sold their fudge at the golf day for R30 a packet. Melany and Ann van der Merwe. Ann said the company had plans to raise additional funds for the organisation. “Our goal is to get the fudge into every SPAR and shop so that we can raise even more money for Huis Betlehem.” Two auctions were also held. One, of sports memorabilia, was presented by former Springbok rugby player Thys Burger and R6 500 was made. Another auction of sponsored gifts, run by Melany van der Merwe, raised R6 000. Johnny Smit, Christiaan de Jager, Gareth Townsend and Jaco Retief from De Jager Transport. Ann said that they were pleased with the total, and grateful to all who contributed. She also urged members of the public and companies to continue to make contributions to keep Huis Betlehem’s doors open.
