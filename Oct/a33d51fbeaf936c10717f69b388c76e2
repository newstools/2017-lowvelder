 WHITE RIVER – CANSA Lowveld selected and named its brand-new ambassadors last weekend, when the first-ever CANSA Socialite took place at The Barnyard at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre on Sunday.  The purpose of the event was to raise funds and awareness for CANSA Lowveld as well as to give models (and non-models alike) across the Lowveld exposure. The top judging panel comprised four experts, including owner of the South African Talent Championship (SATCH) and recruiter for Wilhelmina modelling agency in New York, Nastassja Ras; Mrs America 2014, Austen Williams; Boss Models Johannesburg owner, Lara White; and recruiter for Top Model South Africa, Angeli Marais. Candice Paterson, co-owner of Master Models Nelspruit, who organised the event, said the judges were impressed with the MC, the production and the local talent on  the day. A number of organisations helped CANSA Lowveld’s Jacqueline Weideman realise her vision of CANSA Socialite: Aside from Master Modela, these included SATCH and Union Motors. The CANSA finalists also worked to bring in R10 000 for the organisation.  The winners were automatically entered into SATCH 2018 and each received the right to be brand ambassadors for CANSA Lowveld. A number of models received callbacks.  Five of them received callbacks from Boss Models. These individuals were Bajabulise, Mariska Pretorius, Sarah van Rijswijk, Meg Smith and Rachel Cruse. There were also two callbacks from Wilhelmina. The models who received these callbacks were the winners of the girl and boy 13 to 19 category.
