On October 9 the institution received the PMR Diamond Award at a prize-giving ceremony in Mbombela. The prizes were received on behalf of Gert Sibande by college council member Ms Dudu Thwala, acting principal Ms Portia Radingwane, acting CFO Mr Ebrahim Khan, and student support manager Ms Regina Mampye. “We are excited that Gert Sibande was among the best institutions, based on the perception of about 160 senior managers in Mpumalanga. “The purpose of the awards was to create a global and unique marketing tool for the institutions to enhance excellence in the industry. It also sets a benchmark to create an opportunity for companies and institutions, whereby a team or division is recognised for all their hard work,” said the college’s communication and marketing team. Gert Sibande also received the Minister’s Award for the most innovative curriculum programme from the former minister of higher education, Dr Blade Nzimande, and deputy minister of economic development Mr Madala Masuku on October 3, at the TVET Imbizo Gala Dinner held at The Lakes Hotel and Conference Centre in Benoni. The college was selected and awarded the opportunity to establish a centre of specialisation for millwrights in Standerton at the Centre of Artisan Development. The centre manager of the skills academy and artisan development, Ms Monica Swart, said this is an exciting prospect for the college and its community, and many opportunities will be created for the youth of Gert Sibande. “We are looking forward to the implementation, and the skills centre will do its utmost to make it a success. Employers should grab this opportunity to partner with the college to ensure that we train quality artisans needed in the workplace,” concluded Swart.
