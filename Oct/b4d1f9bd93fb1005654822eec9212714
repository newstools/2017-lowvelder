 MBOMBELA- The Mulder girls are, for the first time in five weeks, finally reunited. Leané (4) and Zamoné (19 months) were finally able to visit their baby sister after almost two months apart on Monday. The toddlers could not visit their sister at the Netcare Waterfall City Hospital in Midrand as child visitors are not allowed.  They are, however, allowed at the Netcare Rehabilitation Hospital in Auckland Park where the eight-month old is undergoing treatment. “At first I wondered if it was a good idea, but I did not want to disappoint Leané and Zamoné” said their mother Verna in a post on the Facebook page, Please Pray for Mienke. “But I am so happy that I did it and it is the best thing I could have done,” she added.  She goes on to say that the moment was emotional for everyone. Mienke is, for the next two weeks, undergoing assessments at the hospital to see what the therapists should focus on on her continued treatment.
