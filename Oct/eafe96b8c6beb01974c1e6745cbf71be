Ruan Venter, registrar of Boston City Campus & Business College says, “When you are investigating where to study the qualification of your choice, make sure that the campus you attend ticks the boxes on your checklist. Registration of your place of study as well as of your qualification must be assured. Do not pour your hard earned money into a college without evidence of both”.  Venter advises, “Check that the institution is registered with the department of higher education and training. Ensure also that the qualification appears on the SAQA website with a SAQA registration ID on their website.” Venter also advises that one should be aware that short learning programmes with less than 120 credits must not be assumed to be registered in the same space. “You can check the institutions website or the DET to view registration of the intuition”.  Venter cautions in the instance where there is no enrolment or application process for approval to enrol. “If it’s a case of just register and pay the tuition fee, take great caution” he says. “Every student must meet enrolment criteria of a registered qualification. Therefore you must always apply and be approved for your academic studies”. Other items to have on your checklist?  To ensure your personal satisfaction while you are studying, also look at the following: 
• Is the institution accredited by a national body?
• Are there social facilities on the campus?
• Is there safe parking or easy access to public transport?
• Is the particular course you are interested in recognised nationally? And internationally?
• How long has the institution been around? Does it have a good reputation? Do you know anyone who has graduated from there?
• Make sure it is financially sound.
• What will be done if you find you are not enjoying your course? Are you able to swap over to another qualification?
• Does the institution attempt to find you workplace experience and/ or a job?  Once you have established what you want to study and where, make very sure of all application and registration deadlines. Get these in writing and set a reminder on your phone. Get your applications in sooner rather than later!
