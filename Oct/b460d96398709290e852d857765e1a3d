 MBOMBELA – Women of Faith will be hosting its first-ever breakfast in the Lowveld in November. Like the magazine, the breakfast aims to give women from all walks of life spiritual motivation. “In a fast-paced modern society where the day is busy and stressful, we want to introduce people to a fresh new mindset,” said magazine owner and event organiser, Durban businesswoman Liz Naidoo. “We are passionate about living a healthy and wholesome life.”
Naidoo, the mother of two sons, came up with the inspiration to start the magazine when she went through a tough time in her life in 2005. “I was going through my divorce. I was very depressed.” During this time she moved from Johannesburg, back in with her mother in Durban. One day, while flipping through a magazine, she was inspired to start her own: a Christian women’s magazine. She had no immediate energy for it, so instead started a recruitment business in 2013. “It was not fulfilling. I always just felt that there was something more that I could do.” With no experience in the media industry, she did research, which often made it seem as though the magazine would remain only a dream. Yet she decided to jump in head first. “I never gave up. My focus has always been God.” Through this, she hopes to inspire and motivate other women and to challenge them to be optimistic champions of faith. The breakfast will take place on Saturday 18 November at Kuzuri. For more information email Liz Naidoo on info@womanoffaith.co.za or contact 083-312-9383
