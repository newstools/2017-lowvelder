 WHITE RIVER – A number of local disabled people recently recently received much needed wheelchairs, from the Behring Global Education Foundation (BGEF). International philanthropist Kennith E Behring (pictured in the centre), founder of the NGO BGEF, attended the event on Saturday. The organisation seeks to better the lives of individuals in poverty stricken communities worldwide. It has delivered more than one million wheelchairs around the world and founded 30 natural history museums in China, to educate the public on the importance of global conservation efforts.  Behring and his associates handed over the wheelchairs to community members. Behring also paid for a number of toys which were given to the children who received wheelchairs. The community members enjoyed a free meal provided by the company before leaving for their homes.  “One wheelchair can help several people. For the person receiving the wheelchair, it gives them the gift of mobility. For their families it helps them to more effectively care for the individual who received the wheelchair,” said Behring.
