 SABIE – The decomposed body of a man was retrieved from the bottom of a cliff in a Sappi plantation on Monday – three days after it was reportedly first discovered by employees. According to police spokesman, Col Mtsholi Bhembhe, the workers immediately alerted their superior on September 29. He told them that he would report the matter to the police.  “It appears that he forgot, because the workers saw the body again on Monday, and it was then that they alerted the police,” said Bhembhe. The previous days’ rain had moved the corpse slightly. The Ehlanzeni Diving Unit and police retrieved the body which had fallen 15 metres off the edge.  It is believed that the man was in his early 30s and his body had been in the plantation for two months. He is believed to be from Bushbuckridge. Lowvelder previously reported that he could be from Matsulu. Bhembhe said it was not easy to identify the man as he was not wearing any clothes. “The family of the Bushbuckridge man could also not identify him because he is decomposed.” An inquest docket has been opened. Sappi spokesman, Elsabe Coetzee, said they are not aware of the incident. It is, however, possible that the body was discovered by contractors in the plantation.  “We unfortunately were not informed or consulted,” said Coetzee. She added that they will cooperate fully with the police. On the same day, the body of a 15-year-old was retrieved from a river mere metres away from the man. Edmond Pelaelo Mashiloane had been swimming with friends in the river. “His friends saw him go into the water and when he did not surface, they ran home to report the matter,” said Bhembhe. The diving unit was called in and he was pulled out of the water. An inquest docket was opened.
