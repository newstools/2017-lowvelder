MBOMBELA &#8211; The occupational health and safety department of the labour relations offices may check on businesses to have certain things such as posters with safety laws on display and adequate first-aid kits.A man, going by the aliases of Jason or Jovan Botha, has allegedly been &#8220;inspecting&#8221; businesses. He then offers them new posters and kits at a discounted price to be installed the next day, should they pay him in cash up front.After the unsuspecting owner pays him, thinking they will be spared a fine later, he leaves them with only a fake number and a deficit in the till. Lida-Louise Wiid, manager of Soapreme Clean in Sabie, spoke to Lowvelder regarding Botha&#8217;s visit to her store.&#8220;He came in and told us that he is from the labour department. He wanted to sell us the mandatory health-and-safety posters, check our first-aid kit, and refill fire extinguishers. We already had everything in place, so I told him that we did not need to buy anything from him. He made small talk, and offered to help an employee to reduce data usage. The next moment he was gone, with the phone,&#8221; she told Lowvelder. The employee reported the phone as stolen to the police.The man targeted the business next door as well, where he managed to secure a R800 &#8220;deposit&#8221; for goods that would never be delivered.&#8220;He told the woman she would get a discount if she paid up front. He gave her a fake name and number, and left,&#8221; said Wiid. She was not suspicious of him at all, as he was well spoken, polite, and did his homework before coming.&#8220;He named all of the owners of the businesses in town, stating that they supported him by buying his posters and kits. Since he used their first and last names, I really believed he met them all and provided a service to them. I did not have any doubt in him at all,&#8221; she said. A week later, a local hair salon and a Pilates studio was targeted. At Baroque Hair Studio in Riverside, he took R650 and two cellphones, and at Reboot Barre Mat and Fitness in the Steiltes centre, R600 was procured.Bongi Mojalefa, acting spokesman for occupational health and safety would like to warn the public, stating the following:
