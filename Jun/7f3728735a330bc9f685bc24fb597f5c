MBOMBELA &#8211; Some residents claim that for years, they have not even considered approaching a local licensing office, being sure of it that licences can only be obtained through bribery.However, as many residents complained, others shared the positive experiences they have had to legitimately earn their driver&#8217;s licences.After a recent post by a local on social media, it became apparent that the reputation of the licensing departments of White River and Mbombela was not all that great.It appeared that young learner drivers were all driving to neighbouring towns, as they feared being asked for a bribe and, therefore, not even attempting to use the local facilities.Lowvelder asked readers whether they had ever been asked for a bribe in order to be passed. Some had a fair and just process, others were not that lucky.Frikkie van Wyk, driving instructor for Action Saver Driving School, and vice-chairman of the Mpumalanga Driving School Assosiation, told the newspaper that bribery is not as common as the public would like to think.&#8220;None of my students were ever asked for a bribe in the eight years I&#8217;ve been in the business. I am sure there are some people who are asked for a bribe, but an official will never ask it of someone that goes through a driving school, because if they are caught, they will be fired. Many people also mess up, and would rather say that they were asked for a bribe than admit they failed.&#8221; Van Wyk urged the public to report any official who asks for a bribe, and to provide as much evidence as possible.&#8220;Try to get it on a recording, or tape it. Without evidence, the report cannot be taken seriously, as it is your word against the official&#8217;s.&#8221; Spokesman of the city of Mbombela, Joseph Ngala, could not be reached for comment before going to press.
