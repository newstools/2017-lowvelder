  Adolescents who have been physically or mentally abused at home and have been bullied at school may be more susceptible to get into fights or to be violent. The average age of male youth involvement in crime is 16 years. Poor school performance is one of the most important predictors of criminal behaviour.  Use of alcohol and marijuana is very prevalent among adolescents. Males are much more likely than females to binge drink (five or more drinks at one time) and also drive a vehicle while intoxicated. Adolescents who initiate alcohol or substance use at an early age, may be involved in multiple health risk behaviours. Many adolescent males are sexually active before 18 years of age. Those who engage in multiple risk behaviours are more likely to have unprotected sexual intercourse, increasing the rate of pregnancy and STIs. Despite public health efforts to educate teens about prevention of STIs, condoms are not used consistently. Heterosexual orientation should not be presumed in young men, and questions about dating and sexual attraction should be sex neutral. Having had sexual activity with someone of the same sex does not mean the teen is gay.
