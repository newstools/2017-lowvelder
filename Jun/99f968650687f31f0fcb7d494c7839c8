WHITE RIVER &#8211; Aon South Africa donated clothes, bedding, and baby products to two safe havens for children on June 7, as part of the company&#8217;s global initiative to uplift their local communities.&#8220;Aon companies all over the world are doing their part as their bit for humanity as a whole,&#8221; said Paul Dickson, branch manager. Huis Bethlehem and Michael&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Village each received 15 boxes of donated goods.&#8220;We accumulated the donations internally, from clients and friends. It took about three weeks,&#8221; said Dickson. Marlene and Andr van der Merwe, the foster parents of the house, started the haven 18 years ago.&#8220;We still say today what we said from the start; had it not been for the generosity of the community and companies such as Aon, we would not have lasted three months. When we receive blessings such as these, it makes our lives easier and enables us to take care of the children who need us,&#8221; said Andr . After the trip to Huis Bethlehem, the same was done for the children at Michael&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Village.
