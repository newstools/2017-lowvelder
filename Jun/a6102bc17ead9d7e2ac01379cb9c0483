MARLOTH PARK &#8211; Coming across a chimp called Missy on a farm in Liberia in 2013, was the start of a heart-wrenching journey for Gail Gillespie-Fox and led her to write a book about her experiences.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there will ever be anything else to equal it in my life,&#8221; said Gail. She ran her own dog-grooming business in Johannesburg for 18 years, a career she treasured but gave up to move to Liberia to join her partner, Mark.Her life changed when she met a woman carrying an orphaned baby chimpanzee.The tiny creature had been captured by bush-meat hunters who had murdered her chimp mother and family.The orphan&#8217;s name was Missy, and Gail wrote a book Her Name is Missy, about the experience.Gail picked the chimp up and it clung to her.&#8220;I saw her trusting eyes and was mesmerised by the look she gave me.&#8221;Her life changed. After seeing Missy on other visits to a farm where she lived, she vowed to find Missy a sanctuary where she could live with her own kind.Eventually she could take Missy home from where she was living to an apartment in the compound where they were staying.&#8220;She was as delightful as a mischievous toddler.&#8221;Then, just as she was about to get Missy a new life in a sanctuary, Ebola struck in 2015 and no animals were allowed to be exported out of Liberia.Gail and Mark Gillespie-FoxThere was also an advertising campaign which gave the perception that chimps gave humans Ebola. This increased the number of chimps being killed.She often had to hide Missy, could not get her to the vet easily and with Mark had to live like a criminal on the run.She started to look for a sanctuary, and Chimp Eden near Mbombela agreed to take Missy in.Jessica, matriarch of Group 1, at Chimp EdenThis could not happen, because Liberia agreed not to sign any Cites-export document for greater-ape species.When people started dying of Ebola in Liberia and Guinea, the threat to Missy became greater.
