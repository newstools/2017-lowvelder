LYDENBURG &#8211; This Zimbabwean proverb is very true for the 70 residents, including 13 children, living at the former Lelievlei Camp.This halfway camp, now known as Soli Deo Gloria is, however, doing everything necessary to repair the damage done by the former management.According to Gerda Venter of Solidarity Helping Hand, the camp is returning to what it was originally intended to be: a safe haven for people who have been dealt a bad hand in life.Although the camp and its residents are slowly but surely recovering and regaining their self-esteem, the needs remain enormous, especially in terms of electricity, linen, furniture and food.Irrevocable damage has been done to the integrity of the Lelievlei project and several donors have withdrawn as a result of the irregularities of the past.&#8220;We are slowly turning the camp around. We still have various needs that have to be provided, including electrifying the camp, extra bed linen, furniture and food. &#8221;The residents also include 11 elderly, who are dependent on the camp for a roof over their heads and food on the table.The camp is, however, still without electricity in the middle of winter on account of a breached meter box by the previous management. The camp owes Thaba Chweu Local Municipality about R18 000, despite the fact that this illegal connection was done while officials of the same governing body were &#8220;in charge&#8221; of it for several months.&#8220;Our biggest need is power. We have a few solar panels for lights, but they only come on at about 20:00. We would like the residents to sit together as a family in the dining hall, but it is hardly possible without lighting. It&#8217;s winter and it gets extremely cold in the camp. The gas in our gas bottles freezes some nights.&#8221;The camp is dependent on a donkey for hot water, but even that is now packing up. &#8220;The donkey has been brazed several times. It would seem that it is finally breaking down.&#8221;Another major concern is the ablution blocks. There are only two toilets and two showers for all the residents.&#8220;We are getting the vegetable garden back on track, but we need compost and seed for that. The wall in the dining hall is also giving way and we need the help of a building contractor.&#8221;According to Venter, food is always a big concern. &#8220;Vegetables, fruit and meat are a big need as is linen and furniture.Most of the furniture and other camp resources were sold and pawned before we took over.&#8221;Venter has strict rules she applies. &#8220;We now only have local residents staying here. We cannot accommodate any other people for the next six months as the Wendy huts need urgent repairs.&#8221;Venter wants to thank everyone who has supported them so far.The damage suffered as a result of the former management and its decisions is, however, still haunting the camp.Venter says she would like to call on the community to support the residents and new management. She has also shown the pantry to the newspaper. &#8220;The food you see here will last us only a couple of days.&#8221;
