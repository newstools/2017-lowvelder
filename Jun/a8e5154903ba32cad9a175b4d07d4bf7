Store it on as few formats as possible &#8211; do not copy it to mail, fax, external drive, flash drive, disk, and paper print. Only have it on one place, and a second as backup, maximum. Retain it for the time it is used, or as long as needed for auditing/legal reasons. Once it is no longer needed for its intended purpose, destroy it. If you need to retain information for records, destroy anything else that may not be necessary. For instance, keep the person&#8217;s name and contact details, but destroy their ID/passport information, credit card details and so on. Do not &#8220;sell&#8221; anyone&#8217;s private information unless they have given you permission to do so. Keep information secure and safe, using proper encryption software and reputable IT support.Pieter Erasmus, Adele Potgieter and Eric Kobrinowski.&#8220;Clearing your records and decluttering your system of information you no longer need will help your business,&#8221; he concluded.Noleen Pillay and Tom Vorster.&#8220;If you can prove that you do not hoard personal information and show that you are handling it with care, those who will scrutinise your business, should you mess up, will be more lenient.&#8221;
