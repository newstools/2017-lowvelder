MBOMBELA &#8211; The management of the Trans African Concession (TRAC) N4 Toll Route is committed to upgrading the route to comply to world-class standards hence regular upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance are necessary. Travellers are requested to remain patient on the roads.&#8220;Although this may at times be inconvenient to road users, the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term traffic disruptions, as such improvements result in a safer, easier-to-use highway,&#8221; said Solange Soares-Nicholson, TRAC&#8217;s communication manager.The company has already begun with the expansion and rehabilitation of the Clewer and OR Tambo interchanges that will see a portion of this section of the highway expanded to six lanes.The R290-million project will include pavement, rehabilitation, and ancillary works such as guardrails and drainage upgrades.Another section of the toll road under construction is between Malaga Hotel and the Montrose intersection in Elands Valley.TRAC&#8217;s extensive upgrades in Mozambique are ongoing. The work between Ressano Garcia and Moamba not only includes the rehabilitation of the road, but also the construction of six bridges, including the Moamba interchange.Two permanent stop-and-gos are currently in effect.Drivers can expect delays of approximately 15 minutes.The much-anticipated upgrade of the N4 in Maputo, also referred as the MDC sections 19 and 20, started in May.This will include comprehensive roadworks between the Shoprite Centre intersection in Matola and the 16 of June circle in Maputo.The extensive project will include the construction of two additional lanes, which will result in a six-lane carriageway.The rehabilitation of the pavement and the widening of seven structures will also form part of the construction works which will take approximately 20 months to conclude.&#8220;Although there will be no lane closures, lane deviations and partial closure of intersections will require speed restrictions as part of the safety measures.This, in turn, may affect traffic flow, especially during peak times,&#8221; she said.The BIC intersection is currently partially closed to accommodate phase one of the project.The closure traffic flow limitations for road users coming from the direction of Cinema 700 or from the old Matola Road means they will be unable to cross the N4.Road users travelling westbound from Maputo are also unable to turn right.
