HECTORSPRUIT &#8211; Sean-Michael Pitzer (20) was working in the garden when he noticed smoke in the air on the other side of the house.His father, Sean, said Sean-Michael assumed it was just people burning rubble or grass and continued working. When he walked around the house shortly after. It was already filled with smoke. He rushed in and grabbed a lamp and a set of bowls that belonged to his great-grandmother, and &#8220;anything he could get his hands on&#8221;.In a matter of minutes the house was engulfed in flames.Community members, Jossie du Preez en Riana Muller arrived at the house just before 15:00 and saw that nothing could be done to stop the destruction. Securicon Lowveld was on the scene. The cause of the blaze is still being determined.Sean-Michael was traumatised and Sean said it was weird waking up with nothing left. &#8220;Reality has not sunk in yet. There was nothing left in the house, absolutely nothing,&#8221; he stated. He said their saving grace was that Sean-Michael did not sustain any injuries.&#8220;I told him that we can get new furniture and things, but that you cannot replace a life.&#8221;Corridor Gazette received requests from several community members on how they could assist the family.Essential household items like linen, clothes, furniture and food can be dropped off at Degswa offices at the corner of Leadwood and Mispel streets or contact Du Preez on 079-903-1969.The Pitzers would like to thank the community for its support during this trying time and for the donations they have received.&#8220;I&#8217;m a brand new resident and the support from the community is absolutely amazing and overwhelming. I&#8217;ve had total strangers coming up to me and asking how they can help. Someone&#8217;s even offered me a house I can rent in town, which is a huge burden off my shoulders,&#8221; Sean said.
