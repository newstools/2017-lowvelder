MBOMBELA &#8211; The agreement could prove groundbreaking for the transformation of golf in the province and the country.Millionaire businessman, Robert Gumede also announced this week that he is back on board in supporting the club, where he himself used to be a caddie, after he previously withdrew his annual sponsorship.Gumede&#8217;s decision followed the suspension of a young black golfer from the club after he was assaulted. Then-19-year-old Jabulane Mabilane opened a criminal case against the four men present when he was allegedly beaten up on the golf course on October 15. Following an internal disciplinary inquiry by the club, he and his transgressors were suspended. Why did Gumede withdraw his sponsorship? Gumede told Lowvelder he simply could not stand back and allow Mabilane to be treated in such a bad way.&#8220;I (was) very disappointed by the findings of the inquiry. I pulled out the money for the Jock of the Bushveld tournament because of the incident. It is no secret,&#8221; Gumede said.His withdrawal of funds is believed to have been the catalyst for the anti-racism protest march to NGC on May 12, organised by Ancyl, Sanco and the EFF. The political parties handed over two separate memoranda to NGC club captain, Zulu Cason, and the City of Mbombela executive mayor, Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi. What was the outcome of the negotiations? After weeks of negotiations, all parties involved in the march reached an agreement which was announced in a joint press briefing on Wednesday afternoon.The club agreed to immediately expel the four white golfers involved in Mabilane&#8217;s alleged assault. It committed to elect a new seven-person committee comprising at least four black members.They would also employ a black assistant manager and 20 core caddies with benefits and reduce black membership fees by 50 per cent.Over and above the 15-point agreement, NGC has written and committed to begin implementing a development and transformation plan which has already been approved by club membership. The club apologised to Jabulane Mabulane Mabilane accepted a formal apology from Cason on behalf of the club. He admitted that he did not think the reaction and public outrage about the incident would be as huge.I&#8217;d like to thank those people who pitched and supported me at the march, along with Mr G (Gumede) for helping me through the tough times,&#8221; Mabilane said.&#8220;(As for) the golf course, I accept the apology. The great thing is at the end of the day, everyone can come out like this and still be friends. Things like this (incident) happen every single day and they don&#8217;t get reported. I stand for change and transformation across the country.&#8221; Change is a-coming Gumede told Lowvelder he felt positive for the future of transformation in sport in South Africa.&#8220;Sport can be a racial breaker. It can breach all the gulfs between people. For the first time in South African golf, change like this is happening. It won&#8217;t stop in Mbombela.&#8220;Mpumalanga is going to be the mirror for the rest of the country,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I would like to thank Ancyl, the EFF, Sanco, black pro golfers and civil society for having marched for change at NGC. This is their victory for justice and transformation.&#8221;Jabulane Mabilane and his family who were present at the press briefing.He also commended NGC for supporting the agreement. &#8220;I always knew most of the members were not racist and I am glad to see that the club management has stepped up to the plate,&#8221; he said.Mbombela is dear to me and there is no part of that golf course I have not walked. From seven years old, I spent every day at Nelspruit Golf Club. I was born just across the boundary in Nelsville and used to walk to the course. It represents the best formative years of my life.&#8220;Whatever I have achieved, I attribute to those years of learning. I have caddied for the poor white man and the richest white man, and have learned how character is built. I want to see more people like me becoming successful. When I was a caddie, I was also helped by some other golfers.&#8221; How will the caddies be affected? Lowvelder spoke to NGC caddie master, Wonder Vilakazi, after Wednesday&#8217;s announcement. He said he was pleased with the promised changes, but was concerned that some members would leave the club as a result.&#8220;If some people go and play at another club, the caddies could lose some of their income. We don&#8217;t know what will happen to us then,&#8221; he said.Some caddies come here every day and don&#8217;t get a bag. They have to sleep in the bush at night. Some get one or two bags a week. The introduction of a basic salary for 20 caddies is all well and good, but will they be paid if they do not get at least eight bags a month?&#8221;He added that he would love to see more black golfers on the course. &#8220;We just hope they will support us like the other members have been doing.&#8221;The changes were welcomed by all parties, who agreed that the assault was a matter for the police to handle going forward.Other demands served on the club The &#8220;unlawful and biased inquiry&#8221; was declared null and void at an executive committee meeting on Tuesday. Cason, whose health has suffered since the march, said biased legal advice was the reason for the committee not following the constitution. Benefits and salary increases for staff. Membership fees to be reduced by 50 per cent for five years for those earning below the threshold of R180 000 per annum The process of application for membership will be simplified. The club&#8217;s transformation procurement policy will favour black-owned companies. The club is to implement a community-based corporate social investment. The club&#8217;s name is to be changed to Mbombela Golf Club. The club is to host an annual Anti-Racism Awareness Golf Day on October 15. Continuous improvement of caddie facilities and the setting up of a scholarship for school-going caddies. Revise the constitution and code of conduct to allow for transformation and development.Read Lowvelder&#8217;s breaking news article about the agreement here: JUST IN: Nelspruit Golf Club commits to change
