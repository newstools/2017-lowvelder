Rand recoil and a declining oil price have set the scene for a further fuel price drop.The Association is predicting a petrol price drop of between 60 and 64 cents a litre by month end, with diesel showing a 60 cents and illuminating paraffin 57 cents decrease.&#8220;The Rand remained mostly stable against the US dollar in the first half of June, with strength in the currency contributing three cents a litre to the drop. The big move was from oil, which shrugged off OPEC&#8217;s production quotas to drop by around eight percent since the start of the month.&#8221; the AA says.The Association adds that the fuel price will come under pressure if the three major ratings agencies downgrade Rand-denominated debt to junk status in future reviews of South Africa&#8217;s credit ratings.&#8220;That could trigger substantial capital outflow, almost certainly leading to Rand weakness which will be heavily negative for the fuel price,&#8221; the AA comments.&#8220;Barring unexpected political or economic shocks in the lead-up to the next ratings reviews, we expect fuel price movements to mainly depend on international petroleum prices,&#8221; the Association concludes.
