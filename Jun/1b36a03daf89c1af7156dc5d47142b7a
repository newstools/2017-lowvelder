MBOMBELA &#8211; A man was finally granted bail after spending nearly a month behind bars after he sent threatening messages to his wife&#8217;s lover. Deon de Beer (40) appeared in the Nelspruit District Court on a charge of intimidation on Tuesday.His defence lawyer, Renay Greaver, testified during his bail application that during his incarceration his wife left him, his 12-year-old daughter was left parentless, his cows, goats, pigs and sheep died and his house was burgled. What&#8217;s more, his car-wash business was failing.De Beer was arrested at his home in Barberton on May 18 after he allegedly sent threatening text messages to Sthembiso Shabangu who worked with his wife, Claudia de Beer.In his messages, De Beer threatened something bad would happen to Shabangu because he was having an affair with his wife.De Beer was granted bail on May 20, but it was withdrawn upon the state&#8217;s request. Investigating officer, Const Makhosazane Sieleoane testified this week that the state still opposed bail on the grounds that he was a danger to society and he has previous convictions.&#8220;He was intoxicated when I went to arrest him and he threatened me as well. He also has two previous convictions of assault. The last one was in 2005.&#8221; Greaver said the daughter had written her father a letter about how much she missed him and their home.&#8220;Since he has been in custody he has barely been able to hold onto his job and his house was burgled. His sheep and cattle have died. His wife said she will not testify against him.&#8220;There are no reasons to keep him in custody.&#8221; The magistrate, MJ Ngobeni, granted De Beer bail of R2 000 on condition he did not contact the complainant directly or indirectly until the matter was finalised.The case was postponed until July 7.
