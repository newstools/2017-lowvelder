MBOMBELA &#8211; Young employees at the company and organisers of the day, Nomfundo Jiyane and Asma Cachalia, invited the top achievers from four Lowveld schools to enjoy a day of interesting talks by influential people in business, media and education, and to be spoiled with goodie bags and refreshments.Representatives from many of the top banks were present at the event. Jiyane said June 16 is about celebrating the youth of this country and their achievements.&#8220;Community upliftment and empowerment is the responsibility of all members of the community, it cannot be left solely to government. We can all lend a hand in a small way,&#8221; she said. Lowvelder chatted to Gugu Sithole (18) and Cindy Madonsela (17) from Ncakini Secondary School in Daantjie about what the day meant to them.The Soweto uprisings of 1976 and the struggle mean a lot to us. We have more opportunities now because those young people fought the system,&#8221; Gugu said.&#8220;We now have access to a good education because of those who were brave enough to fight for it,&#8221; Cindy added.There were also pupils from Khaliphani, Thembeka and Mayibuye secondary schools, some arriving a little late because of mid-year exams. One of the directors of the law firm, Jan-Hendrick du Toit, said he hoped more banks and other sponsors would get involved in next year&#8217;s event. &#8220;The youth and their education are the future of our country. In the past, perhaps the private sector had not been involved enough in the community,&#8221; Du Toit explained. To the visiting pupils, he said, &#8220;It is an honour to host the future leaders of our country. Enjoy it, this is all about you.&#8221;
