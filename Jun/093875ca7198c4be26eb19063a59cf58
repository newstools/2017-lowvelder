MBOMBELA &#8211; The budget and finance committee in legislature had to intervene in the budget of the provincial Department of Education to ensure it has an operational budget this year.The MEC&#8217;s proposed budget for 2017/18 showed a massive cut in the operational budget, which would have &#8220;definitely adversely affect the running of exams&#8221;.The budget tabled in legislature two weeks ago saw the department&#8217;s allocation increase by 7,3 per cent to R19,3 billion. However, the salary bill increased to 80,6 per cent of its total allocation (from 78,1 per cent in 2016/17).The portfolio committee on education noted that this high wage bill &#8220;necessitated an operational budget of only R3,7 billion for the service delivery and operational costs involved in the administration of the department&#8221;.The report found that the department &#8220;will not be in a position to fulfil its mandate&#8221; if the policy priorities were accepted. &#8220;This will render the department dysfunctional.&#8221;DA spokesman for education, Jane Sithole, voted against the adoption of the budget.&#8220;This will render the department dysfunctional and you know it.&#8221;Two days later, the budget and finance committee reconstructed the goods and services budget to allow for support material, sports, music and culture programmes, curriculum support and stationery. It noted that it was not limited to the list, but included all areas for which funding was previously deemed inadequate.The MEC, Reginah Mhaule issued the statement which read, &#8220;The officials will no longer be grounded and will be allowed to travel within the confines of cost curtailment as we were always operating as team education.&#8221;Sithole said the DA would not &#8220;just accept the sudden unexplained allocation&#8221; of an extra amount of over R400 million. The party plans to submit parliamentary questions to Mhaule to explain the source of the extra money &#8220;and why her department was unable to budget correctly from the onset&#8221;.
