HAZYVIEW &#8211; &#8220;It is safe to assume that the lodge will be closed until at least the end of August,&#8221; said Robert More, owner of Lion Sands River Lodge, on Wednesday.The lodge is located north-west of the park&#8217;s main camp, Skukuza.According to a press release issued by More, the lodge&#8217;s lounge, relaxation areas and curio shop were engulfed by the flames.Photos of the scene indicate that these areas had been reduced to rubble and ashes. This happened before personnel at the lodge were able to extinguish the fires.&#8220;The relevant authorities, like the police and fire brigade, were called to the scene,&#8221; said spokesman, Michelle Damaskinos.Management&#8217;s first priority, according to Damaskinos, was to ensure the safety of its guests, who were moved to various lodges including Ivory, Narina and Tinga lodges.These three Lion Sands lodges were not affected by the fire.Yesterday, Damaskinos said that all the guests had been moved.&#8220;Although we are amidst travesty, the event has become a reflection of people turning the tragic into the profound. We have received wonderful community support,&#8221; she said.The losses incurred as a result of the fire had not yet been quantified.The cause of the fire is being investigated.
