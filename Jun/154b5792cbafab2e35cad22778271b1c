MBOMBELA &#8211; The Inkomati-Usuthu Catchment Management Agency (IUCMA) announced the withdrawal of water restrictions in a letter addressed to domestic water users on May 2.Municipal spokesman Joseph Ngala said IUCMA&#8217;s letter was not directed to the municipality directly, the same as when the water restrictions were first declared by the agency. Instead, he said the information was forwarded to the municipality by water service provider, Sembcorp Silulumanzi.&#8220;Because the implementation was originally decided in council, (a revision) will have to be put back to council. We hope to have come to a decision before the new financial year begins in July,&#8221; Ngala said.Sipho Magagula, hydrologist for river operations and data management at IUCMA, confirmed that the letter had been sent to both the municipality&#8217;s general manager for water and sanitation Linda Zulu, and Nhlanhla Khoza, senior manager for concession monitoring on May 12.The email was also sent to Sembcorp Silulumanzi representatives. Since the correspondence was sent to all relevant stakeholders, there have been two council sittings.Marius van Aardt, CEO of Sembcorp Silulumanzi, said the company had written to the City of Mbombela following the receipt of IUCMA&#8217;s letter.&#8220;We have asked the municipality to consider lifting the drought tariffs and restrictions. As the water service provider, we cannot do so without written instruction by council resolution,&#8221; he told Lowvelder.&#8220;Water consumption in Mbombela has actually decreased in the past three years. The purpose of drought tariffs is to reduce water consumption, not to make money. There is no incentive for us to continue with the restrictions.&#8221;
