 Valencia’s Amy Beth McDougall made it two wins from two races, to take the overall title in 5:33:50 ahead of Sarah Hill (6:17:37) and Hayley Smith (6:25:55). “It’s been my goal for all five years of my career to win a National XCM, and finally it happened. “The course at Champagne Valley is the most challenging yet and suited me to a tee – all up and down and tons of engaging technical riding. It’s my new favourite National MTB series and judging by the feedback, a favourite all round,” said McDougall. The overall victory among the men went to Brendon Davids in 4:39:39, followed by Philip Buys (4:44:17) and Matthys Beukes (4:48:13). Former men’s marathon series leader Max Knox (New Holland/This Way Out), who comes fresh off securing two dominant wins at the Sappi Karkloof Classic and the Vodacom Hippo Hollow Challenge, was among the most favoured riders to take the spoils.
