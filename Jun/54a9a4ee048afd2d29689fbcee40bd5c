MBOMBELA &#8211; The aim was to encourage invitees to host a Cuppa for CANSA, a social get-together where people have fun and offer love and support to those affected by cancer.One of the guests, Lucia Ochan, second runner-up in Mrs Mpumalanga vowed to host one as part of her birthday celebrations this year.&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a better way to celebrate my birthday,&#8221; she said. Sr Rona Labuschagne explained a competition that Cuppa for CANSA participants may enter.&#8220;We want one healthier alternative per Cuppa. For instance, you may have a cupcake with cream cheese and honey instead of icing sugar and sprinkles. All the recipes may be entered, and at the end of the year, CANSA will choose 12 winning recipes that will be published.&#8221; Labuschagne encouraged people to look for healthy alternatives to foods and drinks that are high in sugar.&#8220;I am not saying that you are not allowed to have them, just use moderation and go for alternatives when possible.&#8221;
