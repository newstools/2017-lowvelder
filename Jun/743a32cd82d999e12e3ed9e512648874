 The company is lead by a local South African OCR champion, Thomas van Tonder, and supported by his head coach, Jean-Pierre Nortjé, as well as fellow OCR athlete Sabrina Daolio. Together they form a team with great practical and theoretical knowledge. Although it was the first OCR WarriorFit Master Class held at the Toyota Warrior Race fourth series this past weekend at Kwanyoni Lodge, it was not the first of its kind. Sabrina Daolio.

Race. Some athletes want to improve their racing game, and others come in as total “newbies” seeking guidance to take on and train for OCR – it can seem to be a very intimidating sport to attempt as a first-timer. Thomas van Tonder. The class was held on Friday afternoon and it was facilitated on the official sprint course. The sprint course is a short 400-metre course with 10 obstacles packed back to back. The idea of this course is to focus on the speed at which you can do the obstacles – unlike some of the obstacles on the long 15-kilometre black-ops route that sometimes demand a lot of strength. Thus it means that someone that is new to OCR would most probably be able to complete the sprint course.
