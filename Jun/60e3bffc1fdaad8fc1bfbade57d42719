Local anglers Michael Cronje of Angling &amp; Outdoor World and Danie Stassen visited De Hoop Dam in Limpopo this past weekend when they noticed a large-mouth bass on the surface of the water close to their boat.According to Michael, &#8220;The bass of 2.23kg tried to make a meal of a kurper approximately 30cm big. It was struggling to swallow the kurper which got stuck and fortunately we idled past, scooped the bass up in a landing net and managed to remove the kurper from its throat, revive the bass and release it successfully. Unfortunately the Kurper was already dead.&#8221;Michael added that the bass was full of eggs and was probably over-compensating somewhat when she tried to feed on the kurper in a n attempt to bulk up before spawning, which would probably take place in a month or so.Large-mouth bass lay between 2 000 and 26 000 eggs in each nest depending on water temperature and other factors. Thanks to Michael and Danie this mommy-to-be will have a chance at reproducing this year.
