MBOMBELA &#8211; Executive mayor, Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi tabled his budget for the 2017/18 year, which commences on July 1, to council last week.It will be the first time the City of Mbombela starts a financial year, since Umjindi and Mbombela amalgamated in August last year.Also read: Three local gangsters peacefully laid to restThe numbers explained The city&#8217;s inaugural integrated development plan was tabled on Wednesday, as was a total budget of R3,29 billion, a decrease of 0,3 per cent from the previous financial year.Mathonsi confirmed the Eskom account was not up to date but council had taken an internal decision to prioritise the account. With regard to the recurring closure of licensing offices, he said negotiations had been held between the municipality and the department of community safety to sort out the problem and that the revenue enhancement strategy outlined in the budget speech would help to deal with the cash-flow situation.We also commissioned an audit for the municipal manager to look at our money as it comes in, what we are paying and (receiving), in order to strike a proper balance of our finances,&#8221; he said.Capital expenditure accounts for 18 per cent of the total budget and will amount to R607 million in the 2017/18 financial year, a drop of 18 per cent from last year&#8217;s budget.The total capital budget will be shared across the nine municipal departments, with water and sanitation, and energy receiving the largest portions, R117 million and R37 million respectively.The ANC-led government praised Mathonsi began his budget speech by highlighting the massive challenges &#8220;accumulated over 300 years of the despotic government existence&#8221;.He stressed that there is no other party worldwide that could ever emulate the work done by the ANC-led government. He focused on the municipality&#8217;s high-impact projects, including the upgrading of bulk water and reticulation infrastructure, paving of streets and tarring of roads, and the improvement of electricity supply and management infrastructure.Also read: Failed education budget savedLong-term goals He also spoke of the finalisation of the long-term vision for the City of Mbombela.The goal is to be the best city in South Africa by 2030 for living, working, investing and leisure,&#8221; he explained.The vision is anchored on the six new proposed urban nodes, namely Tekwane hub, Matsafeni precinct, Nkosi City, Barberton Mpuma-green precinct, the province&#8217;s international fresh-produce market and a cultural hub in White River.Mathonsi further explained that the decrease in the budget is as a result of the decrease in grant allocation due to fiscal constraints nationally.The total grants allocation in 2017/18 will amount to R1,293 million, which shows a slight decrease from the 2016/17 allocation of R1,294 million and further increases to R1,391 million over the medium term.Opposition to the speech The EFF&#8217;s Cllr Lucky Shongwe was not convinced, however, saying he was concerned about the lack of consequences for people when public money was not used for the right purpose. He also highlighted the Eskom account as a matter to be dealt with urgently.I am not scared by the (big numbers). We are going to grow and make more millions but we must not waste any more millions. We are used to this song. How can we as the public, or as the house, trust that all these millions will go to the right place?&#8221; he asked.
