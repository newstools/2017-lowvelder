MBOMBELA &#8211; The white rhino&#8217;s face was gone. Deep gashes remained where its horns, one eye, nose and mouth had been. Chunks of flesh had been ripped from its head and blood gushed from the slaughtered animal.It was still alive, yet clearly disorientated and in agonising pain.Stripped of its nose and mouth, it helplessly lifted its head. Cries of pain could be heard.Rangers euthanised the rhino.The man responsible for the animal&#8217;s mutilation was arrested two years and three months ago.Vhandalane Makhubela&#8217;s trial concluded on Tuesday. He will spend 16 years behind bars. His two accomplices have still not been tracked down.Spokesman for the Skukuza police, WO Willie Broodryk explained how Makhubele was arrested and prosecuted.
