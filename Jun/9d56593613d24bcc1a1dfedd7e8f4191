MBOMBELA &#8211; The tragic death of the 15-year-old Flamboyant pupil in a quad bike accident on Saturday has left her family, peers and the community deeply saddened and in shock.Karlien&#8217;s father, Renier, said there was just no explanation for what happened. He was driving in his bakkie behind his sister and Karlien, who was a passenger on the quad bike.&#8220;It was a freak accident. My sister was driving slowly. It was not unsafe. Karlien was wearing a helmet. Something seemed to have broken on the steering arm of the bike and it veered left off the road and fell on top of my little girl,&#8221; Renier explained.It all happened in slow motion. I said to my wife that I had seen worse. I knew my daughter was really strong and I thought she would make it.&#8221;Just the day before the accident, Renier had taken Karlien hunting and she had shot her second buck.Elana van der Merwe, who lives in a granny flat on the same property with the Janse van Rensburg family, told Lowvelder her cousin, who only recently celebrated her 15th birthday, just loved the outdoors.&#8220;There was never a dull moment with Karlien. She had a way with people that is difficult to describe. I will miss her smile the most,&#8221; Van der Merwe said.My one-year-old baby is walking around the house calling for Karlien, but she won&#8217;t find her. I don&#8217;t think anybody realises how one&#8217;s life can change in just a second until it happens to you.&#8221;Flamboyant&#8217;s headmistress, Gail van der Riet said the grade eight pupil will be sorely missed by the staff and her peers of all ages at the school.Also read: Community mourns loss of three in plane crash&#8220;Karlien was a lively, happy, strong-willed young lady. The staff will remember her for her excellent sense of humour and the support she provided her peers. She was simply part of the ethos of the school,&#8221; Van der Riet said.Some of the children have been in her class for seven years, and she was a mentor to many of the young pupils. She was always the first to take the lone soldier under her wing, and that is how she will be remembered here at Flamboyant. She was very dear and near to every one of us.&#8221;It has since been found out that Karlien was 15 years old.Capt Dawie Pretorius confirmed that the quad bike accident had happened on a dirt road near Blue Moon after 10:00 on Saturday morning.&#8220;The post-mortem was conducted (on Monday morning). A case of culpable homicide is being investigated,&#8221; Pretorius said.According to Netcare 911, paramedics who responded to the accident tried for some time to resuscitate the 15-year-old, but despite their efforts, she was declared dead at the scene.The company also extended its heartfelt condolences to Karlien&#8217;s friends and family during this difficult time.
