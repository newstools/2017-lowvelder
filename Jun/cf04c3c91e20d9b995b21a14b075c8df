BADPLAAS &#8211; Lowvelder recently published two print and one online* article about the Cradle of Life, an eco-tourism-based nature and game reserve located in the area. The reserve has various facets &#8211; it conducts scientific research, educational projects, endeavours to protect biodiversity and to promote sustainable development, and also prioritises environmental education. In addition to various other animals, it is home to a number of rare and endangered predators.The sanctuary was central to the above-mentioned articles. Since publication, more information has come to Lowvelder&#8217;s attention.An image taken at Cradle of Life on Sunday.On Sunday the paper interviewed Cradle of Life&#8217;s Fred and Linda Daniel. The couple was concerned following allegations that the reserve was unsafe for humans and animals. According to Fred, most of the allegations were false and misleading. They claimed that the project was financially unstable and made accusations that the animals&#8217; veterinary records and permits were not up to date.Another apparent concern related to the project&#8217;s handling of fire threats. Further claims levelled against Cradle of Life held that the project engaged in the breeding and sale of tigers. It was alleged that the institution would regularly remove cubs from their mothers. A five month-old cub called Striker was said to have been removed from his mother and distanced by 10 kilometres from other animals, after which it was reportedly removed from the premises. Fred stated that this was untrue, as were the allegations that the institution failed to keep its pigs hydrated and that a warthog was roaming free and was a danger to tourists.Concerning the project&#8217;s financial state, a document reflecting its running costs was provided to the paper. The document formed part of a Unesco World Heritage application made in March. &#8220;We are able to cover these costs as we have always done, and have invested our own money,&#8221; Fred said. He added that the project does not rely on government grants or financial donations and is funded entirely by the Daniel family. He had also funded acclaimed scientific research.One of the lions that call Cradle of Life home.Further documentary proof was provided reflecting that Cradle of Life&#8217;s assets exceeding its liability by a ration of 10 to one. Lowvelder was provided with exact figures, but agreed not to publish them. According to veterinarian Dr Cobus Raath, he attends to the Cradle of Life&#8217;s veterinary needs on an ad hoc basis. He added that this is done in accordance with the ethical and legal requirements of his profession.Fred said the institution operates lawfully. Copies of High Court orders showed that the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) had been ordered by court to issue permits and carry out its mandate with reference to the Cradle of Life. These orders were dated as far back as 2009. In that year the facility was approved upon opening its doors. Between 2008 and 2011, permits were issued legalising the sanctuary&#8217;s purchase of animals like white lions, brown lions, pumas and hyenas. According to the MTPA&#8217;s Kholofelo Nkambule, &#8220;There has been no valid permit issued to the Cradle if Life since it expired on May 31, 2015&#8221;. Since then, she said, the MTPA has been unable to inspect the facility and perform its duties accordingly, &#8220;due to resistance encountered&#8221;.Fred, however, has in his possession correspondence to the state attorney and court documents which offer an explanation. It bars Jan Muller, a senior MTPA official in charge of wildlife protection services, from Cradle of Life. The order was obtained in terms of the Protection of Harassment Act, which stipulates that such an order is granted if &#8220;there is prima facie evidence that (a) the respondent is engaging or has engaged in harassment and (b) harm is being or may be suffered by the complainant or a related person as a result of that conduct if a protection order is not issued immediately&#8221;. In February a warrant was issued for the arrest of Muller. It contains the allegation that he had breached the protection order. It is not clear whether it was executed.Fred claims to have been harassed and victimised by MTPA officials after having acted as a whistle-blower exposing its alleged fraud and corruption. &#8220;The MTPA has been compromised,&#8221; he said. Fred had, however, suggested that the agency authorise &#8220;someone else, or any other reputable and registered independent body that has not been corrupted, tainted or captured&#8221; to conduct the visit needed to inspect Cradle of life&#8217;s facilities. He stated that this had not been done.According to Nkambule, the MTPA had previously tried to obtain access to the Cradle of Life. This attempt held applying to court for a warrant. The application was unsuccessful.She confirmed that a case against Muller had been opened by Fred and litigation was pending between the MTPA and the Cradle of Life&#8217;s owner.Concerning fire threats, the project has a detailed fire emergency plan. Teams, headed by employees qualified in firefighting, are always on duty to react to threats. The sanctuary also has equipment to assist in fighting fires. A schedule indicates that the project reduces risks with firebreaks.According to Fred, allegations of Cradle of Life engaging in breeding activities are untrue. During a tour of the premises, various cubs were photographed by the sides of their mothers. The exception was Striker.Striker&#8217;s cage is not isolated, but adjacent to another one with cats.He provided Lowvelder with requirements stipulating the minimum sizes of cages for predators such as lions, white lions, pumas and tigers. These are much larger than they need to be, and are electrified.&#8220;Over the years hyenas, leopards, jackals, cheetahs and many other animals were healed in our care,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will never take an animal out of the wild and cage it here,&#8221; he added. &#8220;But when an animal is unable to keep functioning in the wild due to, for example, having been held in a zoo, we accommodate them.&#8221; The alternative &#8211; shooting an animal under such circumstances &#8211; is one that would deeply upset both Daniels.&#8220;If scientific tests and research allow, contraceptives are administered to animals in the rehabilitation centre,&#8221; said Fred. He added that these decisions were made by a panel of experts including veterinarians and a distinguished academic and researcher.Lastly, Linda stressed that none of Cradle of Life&#8217;s animals were experiencing a water shortage. Although no warthog was spotted during Lowvelder&#8217;s visit, she confirmed that none had ever injured a human. Fred added that, over a period of 19 years&#8217; living and working on a nature reserve with large amounts of wild animals, there have been instances where staff have incurred minor injuries, but no injuries of a serious nature had occurred.He asked whether this reporter felt unsafe during her visit to the sanctuary. &#8220;Is this a deathtrap, as some allege?&#8221; he asked. In fairness to Fred Daniel, the facility appears well kept, and his and Linda&#8217;s passion for their project is unmistakable.*The online reports have since been deleted.Also read: Motorcyclists set to rally hope against farm murders Also read: Failed education budget saved
