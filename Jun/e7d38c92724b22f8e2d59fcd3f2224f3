MBOMBELA &#8211; According to the developers, Laeveld Trust, the upgrades will improve the water flow and reduce existing pollution and erosion in the wetland. It quoted environmental specialist, Anne-Mari White from Aurecon Group, who stated that that the existing storm-water system was not functioning optimally.&#8220;During the rainy seasons, ponding and sedimentation occurs, which causes the flood area of the reed-bed wetland and sides of the storm-water channel to erode. This has a negative impact on the water quality of the unnamed tributary of the Crocodile River further downstream.&#8221;Pamela Ntuli, acting chief director of environmental services of the provincial Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs (Dardlea) confirmed that the department authorised the upgrades on March 30 of last year. The water use authorisation was granted on July 2, 2015.Crossing Centre developer, Nico van Zyl, explained that it was also an effort to beautify the area. &#8220;General household rubbish and even sewage accumulates in the area as the stream flows from the south through residential areas,&#8221; he told Lowvelder.&#8220;The reed environment has also become a safety concern. Crossing Centre is a focal entrance point to Mbombela and should be seen as an appealing, safe location for residents and visitors.&#8221;The section of the wetland that is being beautified at the moment, marked in red.The upgrade will include the construction of additional water channels. Some of the bulk-water structures will, however, have to be expanded into the wetland area.An environmental control officer (ECO) has been appointed to ensure environmental compliance during construction and to ensure that conditions stipulated within the authorisations are met.These include the use of alternative mechanical environmentally friendly methods to access the wetlands and sensitive areas, that the water flow not be altered, and erosion and sedimentation be prevented.They must also rehabilitate the water course after construction.During the public participation process, an appeal was lodged against the upgrades by BirdLife Lowveld.An artist&#8217;s impression of the upgraded storm-water system after completion.After changes to the layout plan, such as where trees will be planted afterwards, the appeal was settled.Van Zyl said they included the bird club in planning &#8220;to ensure an environment conducive for bird life is created, which has deteriorated as a result of the above.&#8221;Ntuli noted that the department was confident that &#8220;any potential detrimental environmental impacts resulting from the proposed activity can be mitigated to acceptable levels.&#8221;The entrance to the centre is also being widened to facilitate traffic flow, with the approval of the City of Mbombela.The entire project, including the construction of new buildings to the south of the centre, is expected to be completed by 2018.&nbsp;
