MBOMBELA &#8211; Three armed men robbed a liquor store in Ferreira Street tonight. According to Hi-Tech Security Nelspruit response manager, Callum Mac Pherson, the incident occurred at around 18:45.&#8220;The shop assistant was hit on the head from behind which knocked him out, so he could not determine exactly what happened and how many suspects there were.&#8221;The employee was lying on the floor unconscious for about a half hour, once he awoke, he hit the panic button and the security company was alerted.He said the suspects robbed the establishment of an undisclosed amount of cash, liquor, a cellphone and cigarettes.Hi-Tech Security medical services treated the employee for his head injury and transported him to hospital.&#8220;No shots were fired and he is in a stable condition. Some passersby said they saw three men walking briskly away from the store. We think they must have parked a vehicle further away from the scene so we don&#8217;t have a description.&#8221;This is a developing story and Lowvelder will update the information as it becomes available.
