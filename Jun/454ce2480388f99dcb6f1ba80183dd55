Traffic circles are problematic to two kinds of people: those who know how it works and those who don&#8217;t. The latter frustrates the former and, according to social media users, the uninformed are the norm.Layout artist Wessel C hrs drew up this image and Lowvelder explains how drivers should go about.How a traffic circle works. In South Africa, traffic travels clockwise around these circles. When entering the circle, always yield to the right. When entering from (6) in the left lane:You may not enter the circle at (6) and turn right towards (3). Going clockwise, you will pass (9) and (12) before exiting at (3).If you intend to exit the circle at (9), approach the circle positioned in the left lane. Indicate that you will turn left and do so.If you intend to exit at, (12), (3) or (6), lane changes may be required. Use your discretion in choosing a lane. Adhere to road signs. If possible, keep left. To enable other road users to exit the circle before you do, indicate and turn into the inside lane. When approaching the exit you want to take, indicate that you will be moving into the outer lane.After doing so, indicate that you will turn left to leave the circle.&nbsp;In a social media discussion, readers had the following to say: Jan Henning said, &#8220;Drivers making their way from Mostert Street to Van der Merwe Street tend to speed.&#8221; He added that Mbombelans generally fail to comprehend how traffic circles work. &#8220;The guys with the large SUVs enjoy speed bumps as a 4&#215;4 experience,&#8221; he commented. According to Pippa Botha, locals end up speeding from bump to bump. &#8220;Speed bumps haven&#8217;t slowed down traffic, except maybe at the circles,&#8221; she said.When it comes to traffic circles, she said that &#8220;seven out of 10 people take a &#8216;short cut&#8217; and drive around the circle in the wrong way. They go in at six and out at three in stead of going from six to nine and 12 and leaving the circle at three,&#8221; she said.&#8220;Or drivers don&#8217;t know that they should yield to the person to the right,&#8221; Pippa added and said that she had been on the receiving end of many a middle finger. &#8220;That&#8217;s for driving towards Enos Mabuza and not stopping for oncoming traffic from the direction of M-Care Macadamia at the Orange and Percy Fitzpatrick intersection.&#8221; Koekie Pretorius said people drive like maniacs throughout the city.&nbsp;Are you one of them?
