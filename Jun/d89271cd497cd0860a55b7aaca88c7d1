MBOMBELA &#8211; Potgieter is now the proud owner of a brand-new Suzuki Swift 1.2 worth R152 900.&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to win and it still seems unreal,&#8221; Potgieter told Lowvelder.More than 9 200 customers entered the competition, with 30 finalists invited to the gala evening.The campaign was launched on March 24 and ended on May 14, with Mopani Reward Card Holders eligible to sign up for the draw. Entrants had to spend a minimum of R350 to be considered for the highly sought-after prize.On the night each finalist picked a squash ball with a number on it out of a bag. MC Shaun Adams then stated that all even number holders were out of the running and the odd number holders remained in contention. The odd numbers then wrote their names on a piece of paper and then put these into a bag.Livingstone Ntambi from KPMG then selected five names from the bag.Each of the top five selected a key from the bag, with only one key being able to unlock and start the car. The other four were dummy keys.&#8220;I was standing closest to the car and my name was called out first. My key unlocked the car and as I climbed behind the steering wheel, it started. Throughout the stages, I had a complete feeling of calmness. I still didn&#8217;t believe the car would start. It was such a shock!&#8221; said Potgieter.Michelle Potgieter.She will receive her &#8220;witblits&#8221; within the next couple of days.Potgieter posted two slips in the cars window.&#8220;My one son, Brandon posted the first slip and the second one I threw in the box. Byron is convinced that it was his slip that was drawn.&#8221;Will she be driving the car herself? &#8220;For now, yes. I have three sons so this is a difficult one. All of them want the car. I think I&#8217;ll drive it myself. We will see,&#8221; Potgieter said with a smile.&nbsp;
