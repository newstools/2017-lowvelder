An informant had pointed the police to the homes of Seerane and Masuku in Ngodini. Grobler and his colleagues managed to track Seerane down first. &#8220;He was at home sleeping. We found two cellphones on his bed,&#8221; said Grobler.A DStv decoder was found in his room, as was a home-made axe. Some of the items found had been reported stolen by Strydom. It is alleged that the axe may have been used in the attack.The police proceeded to Masuku&#8217;s home.&#8220;We found a Tosca bag. Inside it was a red bag. There were jewellery, watches, old coins, keys and access remotes inside,&#8221; the detective explained.He also found ammunition and a black BB gun. It struck Grobler that pairs of recently washed shoes were found in both the accused&#8217;s homes. Strydom was overpowered in her garage.She was repeatedly assaulted with an axe, strangled to the point of near-death and dragged across carpets in her home until her upper thighs bled.The matter was postponed until June 29. The two accused remain in custody.
