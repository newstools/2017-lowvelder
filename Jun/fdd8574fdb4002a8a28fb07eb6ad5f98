MBOMBELA &#8211; Members of the public who have visited the Mbombela licensing office and the satellite office in Riverside in the last few days will have been disappointed.Both offices are closed. Lowvelder has received several calls from concerned residents who have been unable to renew their vehicle licences.The paper was unable to get through to anyone on the phone at the licensing department. However, a customer-care official at the municipal offices confirmed that both offices were closed. Lowvelder reported that the licensing offices in the City of Mbombela were also closed in July 2016, November 2016, February 2017 and May 2017.In November the licensing offices in the municipality&#8217;s jurisdiction were closed due to a financial disagreement over payment procedures between the municipality and the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison. This resulted in the offices running out of paper. During February members of the public were told that the computer systems were offline for two days, but the reason for closure was never confirmed by the City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM).Spokesman for CMLM, Joseph Ngala, could not be reached for comment.*Lowvelder will keep readers updated on the progress of this matter.
