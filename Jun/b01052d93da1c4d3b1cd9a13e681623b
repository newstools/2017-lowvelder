The sighting took place 21 October 2016. It was very dry and there was no water in the dam.We drove to the dam and saw nothing at the dam. Just as we left we saw a herd of buffalo charging over the road towards the dam with the lioness chasing after them. We returned to the dam to see the lioness still persueing the herd of buffalo. Just as the buffalo went over the rige and out of sight the lioness turned around.The lioness went and crouched behind the anthill and layed there for a while. Then an old buffalo bull that could not keep up with the rest walked towards the anthill without spotting the lioness. The lioness charged the buffalo. That is when I started filming on my fathers point and shoot camera.We stayed there for two hours being the only people seeing the kill. Whe stayed there untill other people arrived to also see the lions and the amazing sighting.
