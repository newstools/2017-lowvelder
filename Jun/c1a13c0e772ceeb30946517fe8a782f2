MBOMBELA &#8211; The day was organised as part of World Play Day, which is commemorated globally every year and offers children the opportunity to explore new ways of learning. Thousands of children participated in the day held at Mbombela Stadium on Thursday.&#8220;We stress the importance of play in learning. Each game or activity that can be played offers kids new skills,&#8221; said programme director, Thulile Makofane. The children were all seated around the stadium, the field offering 20 new games. The schools took turns, and 20 schools would go on to the field at a time, rotating between different games every few minutes.After all the schools played each of the games, they would be seated around the stadium once more, giving way to another 20 schools.The Pumas made an appearance in the morning, playing games with the eager youngsters.Even though Pumaki, the mascot, appeared to frighten some of the little ones at first, they soon warmed up to him &#8211; and the giant players he accompanied.Community Services Cllr Sipho Siwela also came to visit and congratulated children as they completed their activities.&#8220;We have to encourage children to participate in as many positive things as possible,&#8221; he said.
