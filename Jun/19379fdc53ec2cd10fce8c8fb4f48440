MBOMBELA &#8211; The players who participated by growing their beards during the past six months to raise money and collect books for a library for impoverished children, could at last shave them off last week.The planned library is for the children living at Woodhouse Community Care Base in Mataffin, next to the team&#8217;s home, Mbombela Stadium.The beard campaign was a joint effort between the Steval Pumas and Milviforce Puma N4 Nelspruit.Milviforce is the proud fuel sponsor of the Steval Pumas and awards the &#8220;man of the match&#8221; of every home game with a fuel voucher.Also read: Vodacom and Steval Pumas join hands for charityOwner, Tshepiso Phosa is committed to Woodhouse, which she adopted to provide the children with the best she can offer them.The home provides daily meals to 169 children between the ages of two and 19.Phosa realised there was a need for education, and started the library fund-raising initiative with Milviforce ambassador and Puma player, Ryan Nell.&#8220;As Steval Pumas players, we felt that we wanted to make a difference in the lives of these children. Reading is important. We believe it is the small things that make a big difference,&#8221; said Nell.Together the Lowveld Show, Milviforce Puma N4 Nelspruit and the Steval Pumas have collected 2 600 books and secured R25 000 to erect a container to house the library and buy more books.Also read: Beard brothers aim to raise funds for a libraryPhosa requested that the community donate all unwanted children&#8217;s books to the library. They can be delivered to the Milviforce Fuel Station on the corner of N4 and Hardekool Street.They are still in need of some funds. If anyone wants to donate, there is a dedicated bank account for this charity drive.&#8220;Education is key,&#8221; Phosa said. &#8220;That is the one thing no one can take away from you as an individual.&#8220;Every child in South Africa deserves to be educated. I will always be the difference I want to see in my community. It is difficult to do it on my own, but I am grateful to be in partnership with the Steval Pumas on this specific orphanage. I would like to encourage others to join in on the movement of being the difference with me.&#8221;
