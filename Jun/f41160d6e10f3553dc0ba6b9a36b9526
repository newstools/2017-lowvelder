MBOMBELA &#8211; Penreach opened its second toy library in Msholozi on May 18 at the Gugulethu ECD centre, as part of the Umphakatsi Project.The idea around the toy library is to make it possible for children to develop fine motor, gross motor, cognitive and other skills that are part of their development through playing.Non-centre-based practictioners of ECD collect children from their homes and brought together to play.According to Thulile Makofane, 876 kids up to four years have benefited from the programme in 2016.&#8220;We are working fast and furiously to aid the children in rural areas such as these, and parents are slowly but surely discovering the value of what it brings,&#8221; she explained. Around 425 households are making use of the project, and 30 children who turned four last year, have enrolled in formal ECD centres.The toy library was funded by FNB and complemented by funding from HL Halls &amp; Sons.The ribbon-cutting ceremony was well attended. Cllr Kenneth Mkhonto and the Department of Education ECD specialist Mpho Mnisi were also there.&#8220;The first 1 000 days of a child&#8217;s life are so important. In other countries, you need a master&#8217;s degree to work with kids so young. Here we are battling a poor infrastructure and unskilled labour. We have people who are somewhat qualified, but still underqualified, and we need to understand that children are an important treasure we need to care about,&#8221; said Mnisi. &#8220;Children should not be raised in front of a TV, it is not real. They are programmed and they cannot think. Education starts at home. I see people toyi-toyi for RDP housing. I don&#8217;t want to see that. I want to see them toyi-toyi for education. That is something I can stand behind. Education is truly the best gift. Let us raise a powerful and educated nation,&#8221; said Mkhonto. During the ceremony, before the ribbon was cut, the kids of the Gugulethu centre and the Umphakatsi learners performed individual songs they had learned at their centres.&nbsp;
