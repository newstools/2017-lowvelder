MBOMBELA &#8211; Several guest speakers from well-known companies and tertiary institutes entertained and informed the audience with talks on financial wisdom, dynamic wellness, personal branding and business etiquette.Host Estelle Roe, who also heads up Junxion Communications, said the workshop gets bigger and better every year.Sonnyboy Shongwe, plumbing manager at Swift Group, was the speaker who really caught attendees&#8217; attention, with a short and simple speech on &#8220;attitude in the workplace&#8221;.He had attendees laughing when he said some employees have 10 grandmothers and grandfathers when it came to taking days off from work.&#8220;When your grandmother or -father does pass away, you will really need that time off,&#8221; he said, while also encouraging attendees to become self-skilled.&#8220;Have your own diploma or certificate in your specialisation, but also have the worthwhile skills to fix basic plumbing and electrical problems. If you are self-skilled, you can help yourself.&#8221;Shongwe also reminded the audience that a smile can go a long way, especially in the workplace.&#8220;If I smile at you, you can just bring back your smile to me, and the rest of the day will be better,&#8221; he explained.Liberty&#8217;s Marcus Mdhluli offered some top tips to inspire the youth and other interested parties to take responsibility for their financial legacy.&#8220;Money is a very scarce resource. You either have it or you don&#8217;t have it &#8211; there is no in-between. If you can&#8217;t manage your own finances, you can&#8217;t be successful in your life,&#8221; he said.Throughout the afternoon, there were prizes to be won and attendees were treated to coffee and a sandwich during the half-time break.Roe said she passionately believes in empowering the youth, as they are the future leaders and will be responsible for the future of business and the economy of our country.&#8220;I have aligned myself with businesses in the Lowveld that also have a vested interest in mentoring the youth (to become) productive business people who will then be equipped to be the future&#8217;s business leaders,&#8221; Roe told Lowvelder.&#8220;Each year I also include the SACBW, so that women are at the forefront of inspiring the next generation. When you give, you will receive back in return.&#8221;To the youth who attended the workshop, she said, &#8220;This whole day is about giving back to you. Go and give back to your communities; to the women, the children, the elderly and especially the environment. If we do not do something, there will be nothing left in 10 years.&#8221;Roe added that she had received positive feedback from speakers, sponsors, exhibitors and the &#8220;wonderfully receptive and engaging&#8221; youth.
