At that stage all the roads were gravel.This unique first example of Old Joe is sponsored by SPAR, by itself an old Lowveld institution since 1964.Early photographs like this one of the first Old Joe paintings are rare. It shows an early landmark to the Lowveld, welcoming tourists travelling east. Today we are grateful to TRAC (Trans African Concessions) for maintaining this tradition and securing Old Joe in an safe enclave next to the busy N4 for all to stop, relax and appreciate his latest guise.SPAR is very proud to be part of this amazing community initiative.
