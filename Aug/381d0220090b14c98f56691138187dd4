 One of the highlights of the Lowveld social calendar, the annual CANSA Tea, was held at the Emnotweni Arena last week. This year’s theme, “Life is a Cabaret,” gave guests the opportunity to go to town with glitter, feathers and bling the order of the day. The event gives locals the opportunity to become involved in fundraising in a fun and entertaining way. Each participating business or individual is responsible for decorating a table, and hostesses went to town blinging it up for charity. Guests are also encouraged to dress the part, with prizes for the best put-together table and outfit won by Classic Flowers and Alex Asman respectively. Joburg-based cabaret artist (and Liza Minelli lookalike) Tonya Koenderman further set the tone with her Born to Diva show, belting out classics to an enthusiastic audience.  The fund-raising effort was centred around a lucky draw, an auction and photo booth. For a R100 ticket, prizes donated by local businesses, including meal, gift and gym vouchers, were up for grabs. The photo booth enjoyed great popularity, but the auction really got the party started. Wholeheartedly embraced by guests, MC Dave Walters had his hands full as luxury getaways, family photo shoots and bespoke furniture were vied for. A Coricraft couch was the star of the show, and brought in a whopping R17 000. All in all, R100 000 was raised for CANSA.
