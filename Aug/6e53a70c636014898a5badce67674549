 Speak English, please? I have a huge problem with professionals who talk the jargon of their professions. How often does it happen that you enter a doctor’s office to hear someone blurting out: “obdormition!” or asking whether you experience “paresthesia”. I see no purpose in talking to a patient like that. Trust me, we do not understand you. The purpose of communication is to convey information, yet you fail in this respect. Also, do not even get me started on lawyers. Many believe that they speak Latin fluently, and feel obliged to toss Latin terminology around. Such phrases are followed by an English translation of what they had just said. Is that not a time-wasting activity? So please professionals, talk a language that I understand and do it plainly.
