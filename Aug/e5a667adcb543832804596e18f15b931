MBOMBELA Mango Groove will perform for the first time at Mbombela Stadium on September 2 at the Mpumalanga Show.The band launched a new album late last year called Faces to the Sun, which is quite symbolic for its performance in the province of the rising sun. &#8220;We will be performing three songs from our new album plus the favourites like &#8216;Special Star&#8217;,&#8221; said Claire Johnston, lead singer of the band.Mango Groove&#8217;s performance will be the highlight of the evening&#8217;s entertainment. Majozi and his band, Charlize Berg, Jason Less and Ricus Nel will also perform.Mango Groove has been uniting South Africans from different backgrounds for generations through its legendary music.Johnston said that the band members were excited to be part of the Mpumalanga Show as this will be the first time they will perform at Mbombela Stadium.The band, which has been together for 32 years, began in the mid-eighties during the turbulent apartheid times.In the 1980s and early 1990s, near the end of the apartheid era, Mango Groove and Juluka were the only major South African music groups with both black and white band members.&#8220;Our song &#8216;Hometalk&#8217; was about the returning exiles to the country,&#8221; said Johnston.Although Mango Groove stayed out of politics, its music reflected the times of a generation wanting change. The band brought diverse audiences together by uniting people through its unique mix of African and European music.&#8220;There are few bands in our country that have the unifying power of Mango Groove.&#8220;There is just something about Mango Grooves&#8217; music that gets everybody up on their feet and jiving as one,&#8221; said Lindi Botha, marketing manager of the Mpumalanga Show.&#8220;Since our show is all about celebrating our beautiful province and its people, we are proud to be hosting such a legendary band that has shown us that there is unity in our diversity.&#8221;Johnston said that Mango Groove&#8217;s music is always about looking upwards and being positive and proactive. &#8220;This still reflects today the spirit within the people of the country.&#8221;Get your tickets through Computicket or at the Mpumalanga Show gates from August 31 to September 3.
