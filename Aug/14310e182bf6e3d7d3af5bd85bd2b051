On the Monday prior, the organising committee were one team short of the requisite 24 to fill both greens. No sooner had this problem been resolved when another team withdrew, and the extra team was now superfluous.This went on and on, and then the hammer blow, when our Lowveld chairman, Denis Paiva, took sick very late in the day. Another team was now required to make the numbers up to 20 teams.Luckily, the original 24th team were still available to help, and came in at the 19th hour to save the day.Saturday morning dawned bright and sunny, and by the appointed hour, the participants were all ready to contest the playing of the Gaydon Shield by players from all over the Lowveld. A few old faces back from afar, and some new ones, who had come this way in order to enjoy retirement in our beautiful province. The format was excellent.Four games of 10 ends on the Saturday, punctuated by breaks, and two more on the Sunday morning, before they all retired to the spacious LVCC dining room for Sunday lunch, camaraderie, raffle prizes and presentations to the various prize winners.There were players from seven local clubs, together with two teams from Jock, who had among their numbers some extremely promising players, and who all played with extreme joie de vivre to really test the regular bowlers&#8217; mettle.At the end of the weekend, it was a team from Barberton, TNT, skippered by Tinus van Vuuren, who took first place with 47 points, just two points ahead of The Bowled and The Beautiful, led by John McEndoe from White River.Two points further back, were Jo&#8217;s Team, skippered by Jo Koster from Mbombela.Level on points, in fourth place were the Barberton Pilgrims, with former Lowveld chairman, Corrie Els at the helm. In a very meritorious fifth place, just six points behind the winners, with whom they had shared the spoils in the second round, were Wayfarers.
