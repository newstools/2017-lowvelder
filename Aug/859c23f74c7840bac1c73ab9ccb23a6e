 A total of 156 fish were weighed in with a total weight of 129,23 kilograms, delivering an average fish weight of 0,828 kilograms. Team Hooked Again comprising Tjaart Kruger and Matthew Douglas took top honours. They showed competing teams how it is supposed to be done by bagging a massive 10,14 kilogram limit, including the biggest and second biggest fish of the day. Their bag included the heaviest bass of the day, a whopper at 3,42 kilograms followed by their second biggest fish at 2,345 kilograms. Heaviest fish caught by Tjaart Kruger of 3,42 kilograms. After a victory at De Hoop Dam, Team Venom Lures’ Frank and Ben Gottschalk put in another solid performance finishing second on the day with a five-fish limit of 5,885 kilograms. Third placed Team Alligators’ Morné Strauss and Shaun Frediksson caught all their fish in five- to eight-metre water with flukes and Salmo rattlin hornets.  Venom Lures is sitting comfortably in the lead with 9,55 points. Team Alligators finished third and were in second place twice in the last three events. They have substantially won ground, climbing from fourth to second on the log. Hooked Again’s victory at Driekoppies has pole vaulted them into 20th position – the cut-off number for teams going to the final.  Team YTEC have dropped out of the Super Final bracket from fifth to eighth. Bent Rods have dropped into 27th from 17th by not finishing the Driekoppies event, and another solid performance from Bass Brothers saw them jumping five places into ninth position.
