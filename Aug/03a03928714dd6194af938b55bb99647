KANYAMAZANE &#8211; A 10-year-old girl had to be rushed to hospital after she was allegedly mistaken for a burglar and shot in the arm in the early hours of Friday. According to provincial police spokesman, Brig Leonard Hlathi, the owner of the house said he awakened by a strange noise in his house, and went to investigate. &#8220;He saw two shadows and was unaware that it was that of the 10-year-old, accompanied by an eight-year-old boy who had somehow gained entry to his home,&#8221; said Hlathi. He fired two shots with his pistol after which he heard the unmistakable voice of a minor, begging for mercy. He switched on the light and confronted them to try and determine what they were doing in his house and how they gained entry. &#8220;He then discovered that the girl was bleeding and immediately notified the police as well as emergency medical services,&#8221; said Hlathi. She was taken to hospital and police are now investigating a case of attempted murder.
