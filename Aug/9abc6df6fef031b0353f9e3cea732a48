MBOMBELA &#8211; Not everyone knows that Women&#8217;s Day in South Africa commemorates the 1956 march of approximately 20 000 women to the Union Buildings in Pretoria. These women petitioned against the country&#8217;s pass laws that required people defined as &#8220;black&#8221; under The Population Registration Act to carry an internal passport, known as a pass, that served to maintain population segregation. To honour the ones who stood up for the rights of others, the country now annually pays tribute to their bravery and their rights.Now the day also draws attention to issues women currently face, such as parenting, domestic violence, sexual harassment in the workplace and unequal pay. It can be used as a day to fight for or protest these ideas or stand as a reminder of their rights.Locals celebrated socially and had fun on their day off. There were two main events. Firstly, the Steval Pumas allowed women, children and men who dressed as women free entry to their match against the Free State Cheetahs at Mbombela Stadium. This was done in support of women&#8217;s rights.The next event was the Mpumalanga Show Braai-Off. Contestants and onlookers enjoyed the first round at i&#8217;langa Mall, and those who participated had to cook a main course on the grill. Five finalists were selected to go through to the finals which will be held at Mbombela Stadium on September 1. Read all about the semi-final of the braai-off in Tuesday&#8217;s Lowvelder.
