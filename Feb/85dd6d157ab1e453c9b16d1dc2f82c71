On Friday, 81 of Curro Nelspruit&#8217;s chess players took part in an epic afternoon of strategy. The goal was to see which house would walk away with the trophy.In first place, for the third year running, was Kiepersol with 1 065 points.In second place was Marula with 900 points and in third, Acacia with 770.The emphasis of the day was definitely to encourage a love for the game. It was an opportunity for children of all ages and abilities to play against each other.Curro clearly has some fabulous chess players.&#8220;In 2016, 14 of our learners went on to compete in the South African Junior Chess Championships,&#8221; said chess coordinator, Janene Bladwell.The u/11s and u/13s won the interhouse local schools and the u/13s also won the Mbombela schools interhouse circuit champs.&#8220;Our high school came a close second in the inter-high local schools chess tournament.&#8221;From the looks of the eager faces on the day, Curro is set for a great 2017.
