 The State of the Nation Address (SONA) kicked off with a big bang at parliament last night as SANDF forcefully escorted opposition parties out. The president’s address, which dealt with some key issues that affect South Africans at Parliament turned into a spectacle that grew more intense before President Zuma took to the podium. Outside parliament, SANDF stood armed and in formation for any possibility: President Zumas version of "total onslaught" has begun. It's time to get rid of this government and its police state. pic.twitter.com/7XGyt0evHF — John Steenhuisen (@jsteenhuisen) February 9, 2017  Here are some of the highlights from SONA 2017: As per usual, members of parliament were decked out to the nines at the opening ceremony coming out of their luxury vehicles while snipers watched the red carpet carefully. Mangosuthu Buthelezi didn’t disappoint with his signature fascinator and quickly won the vote for best fashion award at SONA 2017: https://twitter.com/McGreggZA/status/829747973915541504 This woman was definitely second runner up for her colourful ensemble. #SONA2017|#SONA2017Fashion: Shame she looks like a Clown.

He made the mistake of pronouncing it Edimeni to cries of “F***ing racist” from ANC backbench. From this point onwards, things escalated very quickly.

Said Zuma's speech is more important. #SONA2017 — Babes Womzabalazo (@NalediChirwa) February 9, 2017  Once EFF leader Julius Malema took to the podium, the real drama began when he accused Madam Speaker Baleka Mbete of slaughtering a cow after rumours that she was the chosen candidate by President Zuma to take over the ANC leadership. “He used you and dumped you,” said Malema to a shocked parliament. https://twitter.com/VinesBySphe/status/829788580486737921 EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi called for the house to remove the guards at the door and pointed out that a person with a criminal record cannot run for office in the country. He later called President Zuma a “constitutional delinquent” and demanded for the two guards at the door to be removed from the house. #SONA2017 No matter how he may have come across he is telling the truth. pic.twitter.com/AnPqQyuECt — TweetGuru (@JustKholii_) February 10, 2017  Things escalated very quickly when opposition parties refused to listen to what the President had to say prompting Chairperson Mbete to call parliament security, which the parties pointed out were actually police officers using pepperspray. Fists began flying as the opposition parties were violently escorted out of parliament.

He mentioned the government’s Nine Point Plan to reignite growth so that the economy can create “much-needed jobs”. The focus areas include industrialisation, mining and beneficiation, Agriculture and agro Processing, energy, SMMEs, managing work place conflict, attracting investments, growing the oceans economy and tourism.
