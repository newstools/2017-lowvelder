 MBOMBELA – A local Ford Kuga owner was furious when he read online news reports stating that his vehicle had caught fire yesterday. “My car was never on fire. Yet that is the story that has gone viral online,” an upset Mr Thulani Hlophe told Lowvelder. Although Hlope’s vehicle hadn’t caught fire, it did come to a standstill in Vintonia yesterday afternoon. According to Hlophe, he noticed what appeared to be smoke coming out of his vehicle’s bonnet. He called Mbombela Fire and Rescue to the scene. Further inspection revealed that it was in fact vapour, and not smoke, that he had seen. “When I checked I found out that the water bottle was empty,” he said. An affidavit from Mbombela Fire and Rescue’s Mr JJ Helling states that he found the “water bottle reserve cap above the bottle on a plastic ledge.” The incident is still being investigated. Meanwhile, the following has been reported:  Ford South Africa communications manager Ms Rella Bernardes confirmed that the entity is aware of what happened. She confirmed that Hlope’s Kuga had undergone the safety recall repair action at the end of January. “The vehicle’s cooling system was thoroughly tested before it left the dealership,” she said.
