 Athletes from Nelspruit Primary, Bergland, Laeveld, Barberton, Nelspruit, White River, and Lydies will undoubtedly want to prove that they are the golden stars in the Lowveld. Lydies, which will host this spectacular event for the first time in seven years, recently announced the theme for this year’s interprimary, Stars in Spikes. “This day gives our athletes and supporters the opportunity to shine. We want to thank our main sponsor, Obaro, that had to dig deep in their pockets. We as school also appreciate the various participating schools that have to drive all the way down to join us in good spirit,” said the headmaster of Lydenburg, Cornelus Lemmer. Tickets are already available at the participating schools and sell for R20.
