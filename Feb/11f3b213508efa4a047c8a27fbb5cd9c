 Director of rugby at Curro, Ronald Msimango, and front-row coach of the Steval Pumas, Hein Kriek, will be in close conjunction with the implementation of a long-term player-development plan (LTPD). This international model is new to South Africa and only a few rugby unions in the world have implemented it. Role player in developing this model, scientist Ross Tucker, explains, “It is a physiological framework proposed to manage the focus, volume and type of training applied to athletes as they develop through adolescence into adulthood.
