Yet, the elation was tainted by bad news: Para-cycling SA is without a sponsor and Cycling South Africa has informed the team that they have no funds available to help.Cowden was joined in the selection to compete in Maniago, Italy from 11 to 14 May and Ostend in Belgium from May 18 to 21 selection by well-known names.The other team members are Goldy Fuchs, Justine Asher, Stuart McCreadie, James van Rensburg, Juan Odendaal and Gysie van der Niet, but their participation in the world cups are at risk.The world cups are important because UCI points earned there will determine the number of paracycling slots South Africa will be allocated at the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo &#8211; and the strength of Team SA.Gavin Cowden was selected after he retained his C5 time-trial title at the SA National Para-cycling Road Champs in Wellington in February.
