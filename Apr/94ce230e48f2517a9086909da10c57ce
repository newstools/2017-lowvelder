MBOMBELA &#8211; Child Welfare is celebrating its 80th year in 2017. The self-sufficient service organisation serves families in need, with a focus on children.Boardmembers and office managementChild Welfare South Africa was established in 1937 and has since aimed to provide assistance to any family that has social problems.&#8220;We do get a portion of our funding from the government, but we rely mostly on sponsors and donations,&#8221; said office administrator, Penny Jane Tredgold. &nbsp;&#8220;They rely on us to identify any problems in a family so that they can make the best decisions. Last year we had around 280 official cases and another 319 cases which we took on, but these were sorted out without going to court.&#8221; Child Welfare tackles casework and marital problems, supplies food parcels, presents awareness programmes, offers protection services and runs skills-development programmes.The area covered by Child Welfare Nelspruit consists of Mbombela, Mataffin, Valencia, KaMagugu and Nelsville.&#8220;I would estimate our success rate to be around 60 per cent, but some children have behavioural problems that are a lifelong process to treat, as they experienced great trauma,&#8221; said Myeza. &#8220;Rural areas have more domestic abuse and the city has more divorce cases. Parents can be spiteful towards each other, and the children are used as pawns. This often leaves children emotionally traumatised. We help all children with issues including emotional, physical and sexual abuse and peer pressure.&#8221;Child Welfare will host the Amazing Race on Saturday May 6 to raise funds.
