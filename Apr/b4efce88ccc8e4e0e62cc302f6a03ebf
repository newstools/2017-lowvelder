MBOMBELA &#8211; Women are held to a different standard than men, and need to redefine what success means. This was part of the message conveyed by national group editor for Caxton local newspapers, Irma Green. She was the guest speaker at the South African Council of Business Women&#8217;s (SACBW) monthly meeting, held at Emnotweni on Wednesday. She spoke on the topic. &#8220;Free to Choose.&#8221;&#8220;Everything is directed by choice, from what time we get up in the morning and how many times we snooze the alarm clock to what to wear and eat for breakfast &#8211; all these choices can leave one exhausted by 08:00 and that is before they have decided what to make for dinner for their families.&#8221;The drive for money and power is becoming an epidemic and leads to burnout and stress.&#8221; Her message was based on choosing to take care of oneself. She cited The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time by Ariana Huffington as life-changing. Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post, hugely successful in the same field in which Green has achieved the height of success, chose to change how she lived.As the SACBW offers women networking, she took the opportunity to remind them to trust established brands when deciding on advertising and marketing: &#8220;Caxton is not afraid to explore unknown territories.Read more here: South African Council for Business Women makes city proud againWe are the first company in the country to acquire a programme that allows you to pinpoint the exact profile of a consumer.
