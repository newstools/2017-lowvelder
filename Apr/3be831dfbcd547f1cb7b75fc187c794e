MBOMBELA &#8211; Mr Johan Badenhorst and his family bought the school, and now rent the property, effectively taking over and revamping it. Kiaat Ridge Pre-Primary (KRPP) had gone from 100 pupils to barely 15, however, since Badenhorst took over in September it has grown to about 30 children.&#8220;The school never had any problems with the children, but management was not up to par and there was a high turnover of teachers,&#8221; said Badenhorst. The school principal, Ms Margie Brooks, has been with the school since 2010 and persevered through management changes.&#8220;I am the principal and responsible for the grade R class. To me it is about the children and I am always happy when I see a child blossom,&#8221; she said.Badenhorst opted to buy the school as a family business, as his daughter-in-law, Angelika, is in training to take over in a couple of years.&#8220;We all love children and want to be educators,&#8221; he said. Badenhorst told Lowvelder that Kiaat Ridge, owners of the property, plan to build a new pre-primary close by.&#8220;If we are successful here, we might be moving to the new school to further develop this property,&#8221; he divulged.The school had a few upgrades and a proper cleanup done, but not many changes were made to the structure. New beds were purchased.&#8220;During nap time, they drool on the mattresses; that is a breeding ground for germs. These new beds are washable, and drool goes right through,&#8221; said Badenhorst.It would not make sense to do any structural upgrades if the school might be moving soon, but Badenhorst spared no expense when it came to ensuring the children have a safe environment to play in.&#8220;We upgraded, refurbished and repainted all the apparatus. You will not find one bit of rust here.&#8221;The school opens at 06:45 and closes at 17:15. During the day children have two proper meals and two snacks in between, made by the full-time cook on the premises.KRPP follows the curriculum assessment statement policy and the early childhood development programme. Parents can opt for extras such as pottery, science lessons, rugby skills and acrobatics. The school may also introduce swimming lessons.Enquiries: 082-462-5919.&nbsp;
