WHITE RIVER &#8211; During the opening, Bredell made it clear that she wanted to blur the lines around Mary Magdalene as people know her. She wanted to blur the lines between East and West, the Holy and the profane, Christianity and Paganism.Bredell and her grandchildren&#8220;In true feminist spirit, I am giving a voice to the voiceless. Her gospel speaks of her as a beloved disciple, and history calls her a harlot.&#8221; In her artist&#8217;s statement she said, &#8220;I was christened Maria Magdalena, yet I was never called by this name.&#8221;She further explained that she was called Marietjie. Through mispronunciation by a younger sibling, she came to know herself as Majak.Mary Magdalene had many interpretations attached to her in the last two millennia. Bredell aimed to strip her of some of the layers, while adding a few more.She kept notes on all things Magdalene. The Codex Magdalene + became the transcription of her notes and ideas.The collection is dedicated to Bredell&#8217;s late friend and fantastic artist, Judith Mason.Bredell opened with a quote from Mason, &#8220;Dying with a paintbrush in hand makes for a pleasing obituary.&#8221;Also read: Face of Riverside: Young faces to help with charity drive
