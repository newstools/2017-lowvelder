MBOMBELA &#8211; &#8220;Are you ready, boetie?&#8221; Angus Buchan, internationally acclaimed evangelist, asked 12-year-old Christiaan Pannell on stage at Wilde Als Farm outside Bloemfontein on Saturday.&#8220;Ek is reg, my oom,&#8221; local lad Christiaan responded, before blowing his shofar in front of almost one million people gathered to pray for justice, peace and hope at a national prayer service themed &#8220;It&#8217;s Time&#8221;.Christiaan Pannell, Angus Buchan and Clive Pannell.A shofar is an ancient musical instrument made from a ram&#8217;s horn, and used for religious purposes. Like the modern bugle, the shofar lacks pitch-altering devices and is incredibly difficult to play.According to Christiaan&#8217;s father, Clive, the ram&#8217;s horn is often used as &#8220;a weapon of spiritual warfare&#8221;.Also read: 10 Historical facts about cars and roads in the Kruger National ParkIn February Clive made and inscribed a shofar, in Hebrew, specially for Buchan. The inscription was John 3:16 which reads: &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His only and unique Son, so that whoever trusts in Him should not be destroyed, but have eternal life&#8221;.Two weeks ago father and son received a personal invitation to attend the Bloemfontein prayer service.

It just shows how even a 12-year-old boy can do great things,&#8221; Clive told Lowvelder.He was only meant to blow the shofar once but ended up blowing it four times.
