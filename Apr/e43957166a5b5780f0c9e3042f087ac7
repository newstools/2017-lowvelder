MBOMBELA &#8211; Lowvelder previously reported on a student strike which led to the university shutting down for two weeks. According to the UMP director of marketing and communications, Mr Themba Manana, the university then resolved 99 per cent of the issues the students had raised.Read about the previous strike: UPDATE: UMP staff denied access &#8220;We reopened on Monday, and negotiated with the students. They were supposed to go back to class today, but they caught us by surprise with this strike. Everything they are demanding now are new issues altogether, and we will have to restart negotiations,&#8221; he said.Displeased individuals barricaded the entrance to the institution and set fire to wood on the paved area.Mr Dumisani Mahlangu spoke to Lowvelder on behalf of the strikers. According to him, many of the students were told that they would be funded by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) in 2016.Watch: Video of Dumisani Mahlangu speaking about demands and issues &#8220;We received a list with many of our names on, including mine, stating we will be funded.&#8221; The money was supposed to cover their costs for the duration of their studies.&#8220;We all were told we were covered, so we went on with classes and lived in the student residence. This year they let us know that we are all in debt with the university. NSFAS never paid our fees.&#8221;Mahlangu claimed his debt for 2016 is around R70 000, as it would include his class fees, books, accommodation and food. According to the students, they were forced to acknowledge their debt and to sign for it.These individuals also claimed that they were kicked out of residence because they owed money.&#8220;We are basically all squatting with friends, sometimes four people in a room with a bed meant for one person.&#8221; Manana told the newspaper that NSFAS is no longer run by universities, and is functioning independently. &#8220;They can work with NSFAS directly. Between the students and the fund, they have to bring the proof of what will be paid to the university for who. The university is no longer the middleman.&#8221;
