MBOMBELA &#8211; &#8220;We would like to invite the public to come and take a look at our pets available for adoption. We would also like to remind the public to vaccinate and sterilise their pets, as feral cats and stray dogs are a big problem. It is not just cross-breeds that end up here, we have pure-bred, expensive dogs too,&#8221; said SPCA inspector, Marcelle Hoffman.Enquiries: 013-753-3582.
