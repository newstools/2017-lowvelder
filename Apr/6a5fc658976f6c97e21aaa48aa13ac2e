According to the driver of the vehicle, he and two other staff members were driving on the R537 from White River towards Sabie.At about 09:30, a white Etios drove up behind them. The Etios overtook the panel van and drove next to the driver&#8217;s side. One of the three occupants pointed a double-barrel shotgun at them. &#8220;The vehicle veered in front of us and we stopped.&#8221; Two of the men got out the vehicle, the staff noticed that another suspect was pointing a firearm at them.&nbsp;&#8220;They kept shouting at us not to press the panic button.&#8221; They got into the front of the vehicle and the man carrying the shotgun pushed the driver out his seat and started to drive the van. &#8220;They kept telling us to look down and not to look at them.&#8221; They drove for what seemed like about 15 kilometres when they veered off the road into a clearing in the bush.They stopped the vehicle and proceeded to empty the van of its packages. &#8220;After they finished, the men forced us into the back, locked us in and took the keys.&#8221; The driver added that was when he pressed the panic button. Ram Couriers&#8217; Ms Leoni du Preez refused to comment regarding the incident as their legal department was busy with the matter.Read more here: Suspects in court for brutal hijacking&nbsp;
