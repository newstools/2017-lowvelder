MBOMBELA &#8211; It was a fun competition and winners received a R500 mall voucher, a photo shoot and a marketing campaign.Owner of Master Models, Candice Paterson, explained that the event provided some exposure to young models in Mbombela.&#8220;Some of our winners have been on billboards across the R40, others make it to Get It magazine, either way, they were exposed, and it means a lot to them.&#8221;The winners will participate in the R2 project. A bookmark will be made and a R2 coin glued to each.&#8220;The premise is to give the bookmarks to the public and state that we are donating the first R2, and then ask the person if they would add to the sum and buy a tin of non-perishable food. We intend to donate the food to Mama Esther&#8217;s Safe Haven.&#8221;
