MBOMBELA &#8211; Meanwhile, three schools in the region were torched this week by community members in Bushbuckridge as part of the ongoing service-delivery protests, and the DA raised questions to find out whether the alleged closing of 31 schools in Mpumalanga will follow due and proper processes.The premier, David Mabuza, lashed out at the parents of the Bushbuckridge schools for stopping their children from attending school for the past two months, in demand for tarred roads in the area.&#8216;Let us allow our children to go to schools&#8217; &#8211; Premier Mabuza &#8220;We are going to reopen all the schools tomorrow. We will not run away from our schools because of the criminals. This country will never be for criminals,&#8221; he said on Tuesday.Let us allow our children to go to schools, it is their right to do so.&#8221;At last month&#8217;s State of the Province Address, Mabuza spoke about government&#8217;s improvements to education infrastructure with the construction of five new boarding schools and several other facilities, the replacement of 28 unsafe schools and the completion of basic services and sanitation in 222 establishments since 2015.Also read: Eight SASSA officials arrested for corruptionOne of the schools in the region which were torched last week by community members in Bushbuckridge as part of the ongoing service-delivery protests.754 pupils on waiting lists for special schools According to Jasper Zwane of the provincial department, there are 754 pupils on waiting lists for special schools. He maintained that no learners were refused admission in 2017, however, &#8220;as they remain in existing schools until they find space&#8221;.DA provincial chairman, Jane Sithole, said the party will, however, hold the premier to account on his promise to build more schools for children with disabilities.In our province, it&#8217;s a problem. There are a lot of children waiting at home. They cannot get placement (where there is currently space) because they need special attention,&#8221; Sithole said.About 150 pupils from Pro Gratia, Dasha Foundation and Nelspruit Primary recently competed against learners of similar disability skill levels at Nelspruit Rugby Club. Here are Shaun Mabuza and Yulandi Jansma.

Most inclusive schools only cater for grades one to seven. Our disabled children, especially those who are hearing and visually impaired, have to go to other provinces to be educated,&#8221; Mahlakoane said.Also read: Don t give poachers muti says chief traditional healer He added that many public buildings in the province do not have sufficient facilities and that public transport is not accessible. Zwane said projects are planned for the expansion of spaces in existing schools and a school for the hearing and visually impaired in the province.But what happens when disabled people are no longer of schoolgoing age? Jacon Stols is 28 years old. She used to attend Dasha Foundation every day, a school for disabled children in Mbombela. When her mother, Ren Walker, had to relocate to Johannesburg, Stols lost her spot at the centre, which accepts intellectually impaired people of all ages.Now back in the Lowveld, Stols, who suffers from autism and cerebral palsy, has to stay at home because Dasha has a waiting list of 46, and she has to be looked after 24 hours a day.When she went to Dasha, she was the happiest I have ever seen her. Now she has no stimulation whatsoever,&#8221; Walker said.&#8220;It is so important for young people to make friends and be around others they can compare themselves to. I know Jacon misses her time at Dasha. I am also unable to work because she requires full-time care which is not affordable.&#8221;Dasha&#8217;s principal, Shirley Parsons, said there are as many people on the waiting list as the school can actually accommodate. Few people ever leave.&#8220;Provincial government needs to supply more land, buildings and funding for special schools. Some children can cope well in inclusive school environments but at times, this type of education is also not good for many reasons,&#8221; Parsons explained.Penryn Preparatory&#8217;s Cameron Meyer and Wandile Thabethe are best friends. Cameron&#8217;s mother, Nicole, said she battled to find a school that could accommodate her son, until Penryn volunteered to take him in.
