WHITE RIVER &#8211; The car-rental company, Afrirent, had its grand launch at KMIA last Friday, and plans to branch out to other airports across the country. The company&#8217;s owner and CEO, Mr Senzo Tsabedze, has carried a 14-year vision to a successful company today.&#8220;There was a great need for a locally owned car-rental company, a homegrown brand. Our prices are cheaper, and we have 22 vehicles here. Afrirent owns four dealerships in Johannesburg, so whenever a specific car is requested, we can make a plan, and send more up if there is a shortage,&#8221; said Tsabedze.During the launch, Tsabedze shared a story of how far he had come, confessing there was a time he had sold his own personal vehicle to pay salaries. &#8220;I went from selling my own car to pay salaries, to growing this company with a R20 million turnover,&#8221; he said.He mentioned that the secret to the success was the gap he saw in the market.&#8220;People renting cars want brand-new ones as they are not at risk of breaking down during their holiday. Car buyers do not have the money to buy new cars, second-hand cars are selling like hot cakes,&#8221; he shared, explaining, &#8220;I use new cars as rental cars for six months, then sell them as second-hand vehicles. I make money off them as new, and as second-hand cars.&#8221;According to the businessman, negotiations are under way to bring Afrirent to airports across the country. &#8220;We are South African, and we want to be present, front and centre, not tucked away in a corner behind the bathrooms,&#8221; he laughed.&#8220;I would like to thank KMIA for being the first airport to not only give us a spot, but having us right in the middle of the terminus where we are seen.&#8221;The company currently brags an average of 75 per cent of its cars used at any given time, and a couple of fully booked weekends since November 2016. The company is still growing, but offers a variety of luxury vehicles, SUV&#8217;s and C-class cars from brands like, Toyota, Hyundai, GM and Nissan.He concluded that one must always understand the value of a competitive market. &#8220;You will learn the most from your own competitors.&#8221;&nbsp;
