My interests were in public speaking. But when my peers asked me to join the team, I just couldn&#8217;t say no,&#8221; she said.Thando said she learned that hard work does pay off and that the youth can do anything.&#8220;The experience has helped me a lot. Besides school work, it has taught me integrity, patience, concentration and most of all, confidence. I would like to thank Education Africa for allowing me to have such an experience. It was truly wonderful,&#8221; she said.Maru said she did not know much about Model UN when she signed up. She later realised that it was a great platform to learn.&#8220;I was told that it was a kind of debating and I loved that. I got involved and discovered that it is much more than just a good argument,&#8221; she said.The grade 11 pupil added that the debate opened her eyes concerning history, politics and global issues.&#8220;My participation has taught me something vital; critical thinking. Looking at policies that were created by world leaders from the viewpoint of a high school student and finding ways to improve on those policies takes some serious analysis,&#8221; she concluded.
