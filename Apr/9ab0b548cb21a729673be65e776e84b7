SKUKUZA &#8211; Mr Robert Modaka, father of the 30 year field ranger of the Kruger National Park (KNP) who was apparently accidentally killed by a ricochet bullet from poacher&#8217;s rifle on 20th March, said that he is very angry about the incident.&#8220;As a family we cannot remain quiet and do nothing about how this happened and the effect it will have on our family. Our family is very upset,&#8221; Modaka said to Lowvelder.The ranger, George Modaka, was killed when apprehended poachers were given over to members of SAPS in a ranger&#8217;s office in Lower Sabie.Lower Sabie rest campA member of SAPS tried to secure the rifle, unaware there was still a round in the barrel. A shot went off, ricocheted on the cement floor and hit Modaka.His colleague, Mr Marius Snyders, as well as a doctor stabilised him before he was taken by helicopter to Mediclinic Nelspruit, where he passed away.Hundreds of funeral-goers attended his son&#8217;s funeral in Cork, Bushbuckridge last Sunday.Modaka feels that the circumstances under which his son was shot were &#8220;unfair. The rifle that he was shot with was only three metres away from him.&#8221;&#8220;How can that have been possible? Why was it in the room? It seems to be negligent. We want to sue the police, but we will abide by what the management of the KNP would lead us to do,&#8221; said Modaka.Modaka leaves behind his girlfriend, Ms Portia Lubisi, a four-year-old daughter and three siblings.READ about the ricochet bullet that hit the cement floorMr William Mabasa, acting head of communications of SANParks, said that the ranger&#8217;s family will be assisted by the management of the KNP.IPID has taken over the culpable homicide docket from SAPS Skukuza.
