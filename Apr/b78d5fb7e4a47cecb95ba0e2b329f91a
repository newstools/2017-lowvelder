SKUKUZA &#8211; SANParks is investigating the elephant attack in which an employee was killed and another injured last week.A female employee of SANParks, based in the Kruger National Park (KNP), was trampled to death by an elephant and another sustained serious injuries when a group of 15 SANParks employees were attacked by a herd of elephants late Thursday afternoon in the Mooiplaas Section of the park, near Mopani Camp.According to Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe, from SAPS Phalaborwa, an inquest into the incident has been opened.&#8220;Three elephants chased (the two women and man) during their search. During that process, one woman in her forties was killed and the other woman taken to hospital. The man escaped unharmed,&#8221; Ngoepe said.He said it appears the group of three wandered off without authorisation and were on their own to harvest mopane worms.READ about a man trampled by an elephant in KNP in 2016Mr William Mabasa, acting head of communications of SANParks, said at this point it was unclear what the group was working on in the veld.The woman, whose name had not been made public, was declared dead on the scene by paramedic Jaco Gericke from Maponya 911 in Polokwane.&#8220;The elephant tusk entered her lower back and exited her chest,&#8221; Gericke said.She also had a severe open fracture to her left knee.The other employee was taken to Mediclinic Tzaneen with a fractured right femur.
