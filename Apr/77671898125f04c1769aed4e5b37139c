BARBERTON &#8211; Once upon a time Barberton was an international tourist destination where historians and tourists could go and walk in the footsteps of history and savour the memories of days gone by, when rugged miners flocked to the town in search of their fortunes.Today it is too dangerous for law-abiding people to walk on the scenic hiking trails in the surrounding mountains.Thanks to the lawless way that illegal miners (zamas zamas) are allowed to ravage the historical sites in and around the old gold-mining shafts, the town has become a corruption-infested haven for criminals.Hidden in the bushes at the bottom of the stairs is a makeshift stretcher used for carrying a dead zama zama out of the mine. A few weeks ago his body was unceremoniously dumped next to the road.The now disused Fortuna Mine, right on the edge of Barberton, used to be part of the scenic hiking trail. Tourists and nature lovers could get a feel of what it was like being in a mine by walking the rough kilometre-long Fortuna tunnel.The tunnel had been hijacked by illegal miners who chip away inside the tunnel to extract gold.The waste mined out of the old Fortuna Mine and dumped on the slopes of the mountain by the illegal miners.According to residents living close to the old mine, it is just a matter of time before the tunnel caves in.At present, mining activities have decreased at Fortuna since the majority of illegal miners moved to Rimers Creek.ALSO READ: Police link murder to illegal miningDown the road is a flight of stairs leading up onto a hiking trail.
