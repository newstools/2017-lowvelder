MBOMBELA &#8211; Lowvelder visited the site which is booming with business activities to understand how hawkers operate. There is a long row of organised women working side by side to make ends meet. Their will to provide for their families is motivation enough for them to wake up at 06:00 to prepare for an entire day at the stalls.Monareng occupies one of the multiple stalls in the area but due to a lack of space, she trades for a week and the following week space is made for another person to sell items. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a small area and as a result we all need to share it with others. Although we spend the second week sitting at home doing nothing, on a good day I make R500.The good thing is that most of the products are sold out before they become rotten,&#8221; said Monareng. Most of their customers are tourists either visiting Mozambique or Swaziland from other parts of the country. Monareng explains her day-to-day hustle of competing with the other hawkers, but before she could complete her sentence she was interrupted by a car approaching their area.All the women quickly ran to the vehicle to court the customer. &#8220;Each of us needs to prove how much we want to get support. Walala, wasala (you snooze, you lose),&#8221; she said. Originally from Acornhoek, Monareng arrived to the city in 1997 in search of employment. &#8220;I worked for eight months on a farm, but after that I lost my job. It was a difficult time,&#8221; she said.The 47-year-old mother of two was made aware of the stalls by a friend. &#8220;I used R800 as my capital. Ever since it has been 20 years of ups and downs.&#8221; With the money she makes from sales, she has managed to start a tuck shop for her 27-year-old daughter back home in Acornhoek. She can also pay her rent in Mataffin where she currently resides.Although she could not fund her children&#8217;s post-matric studies, she said she worked hard to ensure that they acquired basic education.
