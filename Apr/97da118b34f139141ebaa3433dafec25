Local police have launched an operation to stop illegal mining at Rimers Creek. It started on April 6. This follows after the community raised concerns about the illegal mining destroying one of the most loved heritage sites in town.Capt Jabu Ndubane, SAPS spokesman, said, &#8220;the illegal miners are also destroying a heritage site.&#8220;We did not arrest anyone on that day due to the fact that we realised that there is always someone guarding the area and tipping off the others.&#8220;By the time we arrived there, they had fled the scene, although when we arrived there it was evident that there were people who were busy mining. The operation will not stop. We will continue inspecting the area,&#8221; said Ndubane.ALSO READ: Umjindi s annual report rejectedPhotos of illegal miners (zama zamas) in action and smoke coming from the area emerged a week ago.
