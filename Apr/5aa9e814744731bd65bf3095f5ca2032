MBOMBELA &#8211; A new sewage pumping station is planned to be constructed in a wetland, but the municipality does not know where it would pump the sewage to. One of the concerns is the danger a sewage leak will pose to not only the wetland, but also the nearby Crocodile River. Yet the risk has not been determined; no environmental impact assessment (EIA) was done, nor public participation. At the moment, the final location of the new station has not been determined, but would likely be on Epilepsy SA property. Ms EK Tshabalala, municipal manager, told the newspaper that the municipality took the concerns seriously, however, she added that eMakhazeni was dismayed that it was not brought to their attention by residents. &#8220;Please note that there are several mechanisms in place for community consultation, and eMakhazeni requests to be afforded the space to directly engage its residents, since not doing so will undermine the very processes. The concerned citizens rubbished her claim, saying they have had numerous meetings with the ward councillor present as well as correspondence with municipal officials. The municipality did not explain the scope of the project, what the conditions of the grant from National Treasury were, and what they were doing to address the current challenges.
