You have heard this phrase over and over and over. The area in which you buy a home is your most important consideration. It s better to downscale on the size or quality of house than to buy your dream home in an area that can potentially affect its resale value.Experts say that homes located near day-to-day amenities like shopping malls, schools or medical centres will increase the future value of the home whereas homes located in remote areas with no amenities and businesses nearby, may depreciate in value.Once you have decided on the area you want to buy in, research the crime in the area.With the internet you have unlimited information at your fingertips. Do your research and know exactly what you are in for. For instance, you don t have to use the home loan provider your estate agent suggests. They get a commission from the bank.

This deposit is usually requested a few days after the bank has approved the bond application.A mistake many buyers make is taking a further loan with the bank to cover the deposit amount. This usually puts the buyer under financial distress.It s important to know that there are an array of additional costs involved when you buy a home, apart from the purchase price and deposit.Make a list of new expenses, besides your monthly bond.Considering these costs will help you estimate what it is going to cost you to own your own home.Once you know how much you can afford, you can search for a home that suits you.
