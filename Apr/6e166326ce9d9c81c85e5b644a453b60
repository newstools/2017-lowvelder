This is ill-discipline,&#8221; Mabuza said.The ANC welcomed about 2 500 former members back into its fold at Acornhoek FET College.BRA said it was not worried about the mass departure.

This was one thorn which was in my flesh and I was trying to take it out and today I feel better,&#8221; he said.ANC provincial secretary, Mr Mandla Ndlovu, said the party was excited about the walkover.&#8220;You can&#8217;t run away from your home. When there are issues you need to stay and solve them. We are glad that the lost sheep are back to where they belong and are ready to serve their branches,&#8221; he said.Also read: Zuma preach peace at party conference &nbsp;According to BRA secretary, Mr Johannes Ndlovu, the organisation was not bothered that Maunye rejoined the ANC as he was one of the stumbling blocks to the organisation&#8217;s growth.&#8220;He is an opportunist, that&#8217;s why he went back to the ANC. Cleopas was greedy and not transparent when it came to organisational processes,&#8221; he said.Ndlovu said the party did not expect a drop in membership and support because the people who left the party were Maunye&#8217;s close allies and family.Also read: ANC fine with Zuma having a preferred candidate Maunye said he rejoined the ANC because of its promise to rebuild and streamline development in Bushbuckridge and the province.&#8220;I am for development. I was expelled from the ANC before because of raising development issues. BRA did the same. History will judge me but I am leaving with a clear conscience,&#8221; he said.Also read: Unity in the ruling party still a priority &#8220;We did not go back to the party because we did not have a political home. The decision was taken after a lot of engagements about their plans to listen to people&#8217;s needs,&#8221; said Maunye.
