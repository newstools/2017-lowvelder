MBOMBELA &#8211; The pain still shows on Mfundo Maseko&#8217;s face when he talks about his childhood and the way he was shamed because of his disability.But not the shaming nor his disability could stop Maseko from realising his dreams.The 21-year-old from Malalane is studying towards his internal auditing diploma at Tshwane University of Technology. He, however, said it is difficult for people living with disabilities to be accepted by their communities.&#8220;There&#8217;s a perception that we can&#8217;t do anything for ourselves. That is not true and that needs to be changed,&#8221; he said.Maseko was born with a right hand and leg that could not function properly and that made him a subject of mockery, shaming and bullying among his peers.&#8220;People can be cruel. I developed anger for myself and realised that people are not sympathetic towards those living with disabilities,&#8221; he said.He said the shaming made him think that there was something wrong with the disabled. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t change my condition, and I didn&#8217;t understand why people couldn&#8217;t accept me for who I am,&#8221; he said.The worst part was that no one approached him to tell him that he should accept himself.&#8220;My parents and other older people would only rebuke my peers who bullied and shamed me, but they never came to me to tell me that I shouldn&#8217;t feel bad about my condition. That never assisted me in dealing with my disability,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Life does not owe any of us anything. I picked myself up due to the support I received from my parents and decided to do something with my life. I opened my own consulting company, Take Hands Consulting,&#8221; he said.The company offers typing, data capture, bookkeeping and email management services.He said his dream is to change the minds of young people, especially those who are living with disabilities.&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for the support that I received from my parents and friends, I don&#8217;t think I would be where I am today,&#8221; Maseko said.At one stage during his childhood, he attempted to play football, but that attracted more negative commentary.&#8220;Some would call me &#8216;Cobra&#8217; because of my hand and the way I run. It took my confidence away,&#8221; Maseko recounted.According to Ms Thulakahle Khumalo, from the Mpumalanga Association of Persons with Disabilities (MAPD), it is vital that people understand that living with a disability does not mean that they cannot do anything for themselves.&#8220;Although some are not able to do other things, they can do some, so we need to give them the support they need,&#8221; she said.Khumalo added that MAPD offers individual counselling and support counselling and home caregivers in order to equip people with the ability to support their loved ones living with disabilities.Enquiries: MAPD on 013-741-3699.
