MBOMBELA &#8211; A makeshift bookshop called Gazebo Funk on Brown Street has piqued the curiosity of passers-by, but closer inspection shows it is more the person running the shop that keeps visitors interested.&#8220;Have you noticed?&#8221; said Mr Jim Savvy. &#8220;There are two chairs here. One is for me, the other is for anyone who wants to have a conversation,&#8221; he said, pointing to the fold-up camping chairs.&#8221;
