MBOMBELA &#8211; Former Mpumalanga premier, Dr Mathews Phosa said reports that current premier, Mr David Mabuza accused him of tarnishing his image to regain political influence in the province are untrue.Also read: Premier: no comment on reports about suing predecessor at this stage Phosa said the report by a Sunday newspaper originated in the closing arguments by Mabuza&#8217;s lawyer in the defamation case in the Pretoria High Court, and couldn&#8217;t be attributed to Mabuza.&#8220;From what I know Mabuza didn&#8217;t say that. It was his lawyer who did. It&#8217;s lies that Mabuza actually said it,&#8221; Phosa said.Mabuza initially demanded R10 million compensation from Phosa for crimen injuria. The figure has gone down to R1 million.He is accusing Phosa of fabricating a report in which the premier was made out to be an apartheid spy.

She was assassinated in the 1980s by controversial Vlakplaas head, Eugene de Kock. Mabuza alleged that Phosa and his business associate, Mr Nick Elliot, cooked up the report to set in motion a process to topple him as provincial ANC chairperson and premier. Also read: Premier at loggerheads with Phosa The newspaper quoted Mabuza&#8217;s lawyer, Adv Etiene Labuschagne SC, saying Phosa saw Mabuza as his rival, even though he was no longer directly involved in politics.The former premier said he was confused by the report because Mabuza actually praised him during an interview with a 24-hour television news channel.&#8220;I am told he was speaking very good about me on television. I don&#8217;t know what I should believe now, &#8221; he said.According to Phosa, both parties are not allowed to comment on the merits of the case because it is before the court. &#8220;The case is still sub judice. I cannot comment on that.&#8221; Also read: M&#8217;langa the place of plots and dirty politics Closing arguments in the case continued in the High Court this week.
