MBOMBELA &#8211; University of Mpumalanga (UMP) students continued their strike after the weekend, regarding National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) discrepancies.They proceeded to burn tyres and barricade the road, but the police have since cleared the route for cars.Precious Mbombi and Nomzamo Nkosi, students of UMP voiced their concerns to the paper.&#8220;We stand behind the strike, because the university management need to understand that we all come from different backgrounds. They need to take that into consideration. The students cannot afford the debts they put on them, due to the NSFAS issue,&#8221; said Nkosi&#8220;Our time to complete the semester is getting shorter, and we all try our best to study in groups, sharing resources. The longer the strike goes on, the less time we have to cram everything in, regarding projects and tests. I hope management will give us what we want, so we can continue our classes,&#8221; said Mbombi.According to the students, management and the student representatives are negotiating the terms on the university premises.University students strike against NSFAS discrepancy
