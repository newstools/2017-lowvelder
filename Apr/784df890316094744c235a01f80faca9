MBOMBELA &#8211; The Friday countrywide marches calling for the president, Mr Jacob Zuma, to resign might not have achieved their goal, but political analyst, Prof Tinyiko Maluleke said they sent a clear message to the ruling party to get its house in order.More than 1 000 locals gathered at the corner of the R40 and Samora Machel Drive before marching to the Nelspruit Rugby Club.Also read: Locals join anti-Zuma march &nbsp;&#8220;There were ANC supporters who were part of the march. That tells us that it was not a personal vendetta against Zuma,&#8221; said Maluleke. He said it was a sign of how much South Africans from different political formations cared for their country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peaceful march was led by religious groups, civil society and party leaders, but it was not short of controversy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Three DA members were stopped by SAPS members at the Pick n Pay Centre afterwards and asked to go to Nelspruit Police Station for an interrogation.The police officer who was communicating with the DA members, said he was just doing his job and that orders had come from &#8220;number one&#8221;. It is unclear who &#8220;number one&#8221; is.According to the DA&#8217;s Ms Trudie Grov -Morgan, the officers had repeatedly mentioned they were looking for &#8220;a man with grey, wavy hair&#8221;.Also read: BREAKING NEWS: DA members intimidated by police &nbsp;Mpumalanga police spokesman, Mr Gerald Sedibe said the demonstrations were illegal. &#8220;They were not granted permission to march. The police opened a case against the DA for transgressing the Gatherings Act,&#8221; said Sedibe.However, acting national police commissioner, Mr Khomotso Phahlane told the media on Thursday that Mbombela was one of the cities granted permission to do so.What mainly triggered the march was when finance minister, Mr Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mr Mncebisi Jonas, were fired by Zuma. The country was then downgraded by S&amp;P to junk status following this. On Friday Fitch Ratings followed suit. Fitch downgraded South Africa&#8217;s long-term foreign currency debt and long-term local currency.Former ANC treasurer general, Dr Mathews Phosa said, &#8220;If South Africans do not remove Zuma and his sinister associates, the consequences will be dire.&#8221;&#8220;The credit downgrade is just the beginning. If we continue in this vein, investment in new projects will cease and unemployment will skyrocket,&#8221; he said.Phosa added that Zuma has lost the confidence of those who had voted him into power.&#8220;He has turned his back on those from whom he should have sought a mandate. His constituency has changed from the electorate to other, sinister forces with no mandate nor any interest in a better life for all,&#8221; he said.DA leader, Mr James Masango said, &#8220;The march and the attendance were good and what is great is that all South Africans took to the street to say &#8216;enough is enough,&#8217; the president must resign.&#8221;
