SKUKUZA &#8211; To many birders and twitchers a visit to the remote Pafuri Picnic Site in the north of the Kruger National Park (KNP) will not be the same again because a well-known and loved bird guide, Mr. Frank Mabasa, passed away on 21 April after a short illness.Mr Peter Lawson of Birdlife Lowveld remembers well how more than almost 20 years ago he met Mabasa who then still used to be a caretaker at the site.Lawson was recently part of the team atlassing birds for the Turning Kruger Green project and contributed to the book Guide to Birds of the Kruger National Park by Warwick Tarboton and Peter Ryan.READ more about the Turning Kruger Green project I used to lead tourists there and was always impressed with his enthusiasm and the way he would say Come and have a look! said Lawson.To him Mabasa s love of learning and the art of passing that knowledge on stood out in the years that he came to know him. He was always encouraging people to become part of the BLSA Bird Guide Training program and underwent specialist bird-training in a SANParks program. He was always ready to learn from others and also had a keen interest in bird books. I gave him one and was always amazed how he would pass on scientific names. Two of his favourites were Bohm s Spinetail and Meve s Starling which are regarded as Pafuri specials. Bohm&#8217;s Spinetail.

The funeral service will be held on Saturday, 29 April, at Matiyani, a village outside Punda Maria Gate.MORE about a landmark in Pafuri, Thulamela Ruins
