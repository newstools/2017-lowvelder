MBOMBELA &#8211; When 26-year-old Sais du Plooy recorded himself singing the anti-apartheid protest song &#8220;Weeping&#8221; on his way back from Johannesburg, he had no idea the social-media reaction which was to come.He made the video just over a week ago after what he calls a &#8220;heart-changing evening&#8221; watching the Sharks play against the Lions at Ellis Park, alongside Lions player Bheki Shongwe.Sais du Plooy and Bheki Shongwe.&#8220;South Africa&#8217;s really been through a few dark weeks, but last night (at the stadium) told an absolutely different story,&#8221; Du Plooy said in the video, which he originally posted on Facebook and later on YouTube.WATCH the video right here:The former Ho rskool Nelspruit pupil said he was inspired to make the plea to South Africans to make the country a better place after hearing an artist perform &#8220;Weeping&#8221; in a beer tent before the start of the rugby game.Also make sure you watch &#8211; Video: When you have an unwanted traveller hitching a rideHe explained that it was his friendship with Shongwe that had gone viral because of &#8220;a mutual respect for rugby and people&#8221;.&#8220;I made the video on the first take and I sent it to Bheki to ask his permission to post it. I told him that he had literally changed my heart,&#8221; Du Plooy told Lowvelder.Since then, he has been inundated with friend requests, comments and inbox messages from around the world, including Portugal, Dubai, New Zealand, the United States and Spain. The video has been shared on several websites and Du Plooy has been interviewed by some of the country&#8217;s biggest radio stations and media houses. &#8220;The video even went viral in Australia on Sunday. I have never done anything like this before. It is something totally out of the ordinary, but it just came straight from the heart,&#8221; said Du Plooy who is busy completing his dissertation in commercial law at the North-West University, Potchefstroom.&#8220;I have yet to read one negative comment about the video. If it changes a few hearts, it will have been totally worth it,&#8221; he said.Du Plooy&#8217;s greatest hope is that it will motivate the people of Mbombela to think out of the box and make friends with people from different racial groups and cultural backgrounds.Sais du Plooy came to visit Lowvelder&#8217;s offices to speak about his experience.Also read: Rocker proves he can still pull Rabbitt out of a hat
