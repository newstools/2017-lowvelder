WHITE RIVER &#8211; &#8220;We get lost in the form,&#8221; she told Lowvelder ahead of her latest retreat.&#8220;The form is not the focus, it is a tool to take you to the place you want to go. Ultimately you are looking for a connection, to be present.&#8221;Shameen Yacoob is an internationally qualified kundalini yoga teacher, as taught by Yoga Bhajan. Lately, Shaykh Fadlalla Haeri has been steeping her in teaching by silence and presence.Her Yoga &amp; Meditation workshop, to be held at Highwood Orchards in White River on April 29 and 30, will focus on helping participants prepare to achieve inner silence, or quieting the inner dialogue, through practice.For Yacoob it is about transformation.&#8220;The way in which you learn is through teaching. We must never delude ourselves into thinking we can contribute to the greater good without transforming yourself. Like Ghandi said, &#8216;If you want to change the world, change yourself&#8217;.&#8221;The retreat will be presented with her friend Nicolette Ten Hoorn.Anyone who has experienced a massage with Ten Hoorn, who will travel from Holland to teach at the retreat, can attest that it is extraordinary. Her&#8217;s is conscious bodywork, an interactive array of massage principles guiding the receiver into greater awareness of body and mind.The two will teach according to the level of the participants.No prior experience in either disciplines is thus required to attend.The focus will be on relaxation, sleep, stillness and learning to use massage and yoga to the optimum.To join in the primal journey to unify humanity with divinity, sign up for Yoga &amp; Meditation.Enquiries: 083-785-5695 or yacoob.sga@wol.co.za.You can do these 5 easy yoga moves in your officeYou can do these 5 easy yoga moves in your officeYoga with chihuahua PanchoThis recording of a chihuahua and his owner doing yoga is too adorable.Yoga with chihuahua Pancho
