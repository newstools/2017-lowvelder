MBOMBELA Spectators attended the early morning event. Young and old stood close to the fences in anticipation of each and every rally vehicle. ER24 was present in the event of an emergency.Children sat on parents&#8217; shoulders to see better, while others sat on the back of bakkies to gain some height. The crowds cheered as each car flashed by.One of the spectators explained the thrill, stating, &#8220;You can feel the vibrations in your chest, you can smell the rubber, you can almost see the concentration on the driver&#8217;s faces. It is an absolute thrill to watch. And of course, young boys love cars. It is quite simple really.&#8221;
