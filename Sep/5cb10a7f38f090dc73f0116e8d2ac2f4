 Lourens hopes to make the final squad which will represent the country in the first-ever Woman Tent Pegging World Championships at the end of the year in Oman on the Arabian Peninsula. She is currently ranked eighth among the ladies on Tent Pegging South Africa’s log. The 30-year-old only started practising this sport in 2003, after participating in a country sports day.  Two weeks later she competed in her first-ever tent-pegging competition. “Families have practised this sport for four generations. I only knew two of the 10 items that form part of the sport, but I immediately fell in love with it. I was born on a horse’s back,” she said with a smile. Lourens and her family bred and showed Boerperde, Arabians and Saddle Horses. She has practised dressage with the Western Mounted Games Association and was one of the first riders affiliated with the group.  In 2008 she was presented with her Springbok colours. She got her Mpumalanga and Northern Gauteng colours before and after. In 2012 she went to coach tent pegging in Germany, as it is a growing sport in that part of the world. She matriculated at Hoërskool Delmas, whereafter she went to persue a BCur nursing science degree at the University of Pretoria. She moved to Mbombela in March 2014. Her husband, Gerhard, is a manager at a farm towards White River. They have 12 “kids”. “I have seven horses and five dogs – two Pointers and two Yorkshires and a fox terrier. The pointers would go with when we take the horses for a walk, and the one yorkie doesn’t mind sitting on one of the horses’ backs. The other one refuses to go near a horse, and I would normally put her in a backpack on my back.” Her dad bought Lourens one of her very first ponies, Generaal, at the age of four. He is now 27 years old and went from black to grey.
