Three men from Mkhuhlu were recently apprehended after they allegedly stole an Eskom electricity transformer. Further investigations revealed that the men were also behind a string of infrastructure theft incidents that have plagued Transnet in the area in recent times. It is believed that the men, aged between 32 and 35 cut down an electricity pole near the railway line in Mkhuhlu to steal the transformer, which costs in the region of R100 000 to replace, said Tebogo Rakau, divisional executive for security at Eskom. They then proceeded to an unoccupied building where they were cornered and apprehended by Eskom security officers who were conducting surveillance operations in the area, he said.A case of tampering and damage to essential infrastructure was opened against the three suspects. If found guilty they could face a minimum sentence of three years imprisonment for first-time offenders and a minimum of seven years for those who have been convicted for similar crimes two or more times before. We have declared an all-out war against infrastructure theft, a crime that is, in this case, responsible for the disruption of train services, which has a dire effect on the economy of the region as it hinders the movement of people and goods, said Rakau. We will continue working with law enforcement agencies and members of the public who feed us with important tip-offs through the 32211 Crime SMS line to bring to book all those involved in infrastructure and electricity theft, Rakau concluded.Charges dropped against Van StadensDepartment of Health issues another malaria warning&nbsp;
