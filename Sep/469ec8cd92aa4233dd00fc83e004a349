It was chased away.Some of Shabalala&#8217;s family members and friends arrived on the scene to collect his remaining items in the vehicle before it was towed away by Van Wettens Breakdown Services.A man who identified himself as Shabalala&#8217;s cousin, said he was okay.&#8220;He is still in a lot of pain but we have been told that he will be fine as he is not seriously injured,&#8221; he said.Shabalala was taken to the Rob Ferreira Hospital.
