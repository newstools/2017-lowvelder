 Spring is upon us and the prospect of warm weather excites and springs us out of our corners into action. Spring brings with it the vibe associated with warm weather. As we welcome spring by celebrating Spring Day today, it is crucial that we do so in a responsible manner. South Africa is a water-scarce country, so it is crucial that whatever we do, we put water conservation first. Let us not waste water by playing and wasting water in the name of welcoming spring. We must take into consideration that our dam and river levels are running low and that we are not receiving good rain; every drop of water is important and must be treasured. Let us refrain from playing with water and encourage our kids to treasure every drop of the precious resource. It is, therefore, crucial for all of us to act and behave responsibly and ensure our kids understand the value of water as a source of life and a catalyst for socio-economic development. It is critical that we educate our kids of the importance of water conservation in one of the driest countries in the world. Let us also protect and educate our kids on the dangers of rivers and dams, as the hot weather tempts them to go and play in the watercourses. Let us educate them on dam safety and always keep an eye on them around swimming pools. Water security is in our hands, and our kids are the future, so every drop of water wasted is a drop too much.
