 Herne acted as Marko Janse van Rensburg and Mark Pretorius’ understudy so far in this campaign but gets his opportunity with Pretorius off with a hamstring injury. Flanker Lambert Groenewald also had to be replaced due to a shoulder injury. Brian Shabangu, who started from the bench recently, has also been called up to the starting line-up. Herne has scored three tries from the bench this season and is a vital cog in the side’s driving mauls. Their top try-scorers in the competition are Mark Pretorius, Khwezi Mona, Jerome Pretorius and Ruwellyn Isbell on four each.  Flanker Francois Kleynhans has also been named on the bench after recovering from a concussion sustained in the game against the Vodacom Blue Bulls. The backs, however, remain unchanged.The two teams have last met on August 9 at Mbombela Stadium with the Pumas loosing the match 34-45. Pumas
