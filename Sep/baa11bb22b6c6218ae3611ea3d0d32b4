 Misfortune struck the day before the race, as his South African partner, Mike Stewart, tore his calf muscle and Smook had to team up with a paddler from Poland, Darek Bukowski, in the men’s sub-masters K2 doubles. They did exceptionally well seeing that they have never paddled together before and won the bronze medal.  Smook further went on to compete in the K2 sub-master mixed doubles and took silver with fellow South African Lisa Scott. This past weekend 12 paddlers of LCC competed in the Liebenberg’s Vlei Race, running from Reitz to Frankfort in the Free State. Craig Lewis and Rob Bolton. Smook and Wikus Loots won the K2 vet’s doubles with Craig Lewis and Rob Bolton finishing third in the same category. Gustav Smook Jr and Zanenhlanhla Mbala were the first u/16 K2 doubles crossing the finish line. Matthys Wessels finished his first race with Janus Wessels and Marinda Venter and Lorraine Paquet who partnered with their husbands Wihan and Louis. Janus and Matthys Wessels.
