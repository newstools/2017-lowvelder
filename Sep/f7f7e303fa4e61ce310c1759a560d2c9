 MBOMBELA – Quality leadership is like the electricity which powers the community to a brighter future.This was the central message delivered by the former managing director of Toyota SA and former executive officer of McCarthy Retail, Brand Pretorius.  He was speaking at the Petra Institute for Children’s Ministry talk held at Church Unlimited last Friday titled: “Effective leadership in a time such as now”.  Based on his extensive experience, Pretorius shared his views on the importance of good, effective leadership and some of the characteristics that made an effective leader, as well as practical tips on how to improve one’s leadership skills.  It was well attended and the audience surely took the advice to heart.  Laetitia Bull of Petra Institute said the idea of the talk was to bless the business sector by giving them exposure to the work the institute does. “We focus on leadership training in children’s ministry and over the past 28 year we have trained leaders in around 65 countries worldwide. As we are involved with leaders, the principles such as servant-leadership that Pretorius highlighted, is very important for us, and I believe that for the future of South Africa, ethical servant-leaders are needed.”
