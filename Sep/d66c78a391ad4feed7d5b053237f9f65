 MBOMBELA – The Mpumalanga provincial government has also expressed a renewed focus on tourism to boost the local economy. “In Mpumalanga we are doing well economically, especially with mining and tourism,” MEC for economic development, Sikhumbuzo Eric Kholwane, said recently.  “As much as the tourism has declined in the country, here in Mpumalanga we were not hard hit.” The focus of their projects would be the revitalisation of Pilgrim’s Rest, Waterval Boven and the upgrading of Blyde River Canon, the Three Rondavels and other tourist attractions around Graskop.  Issues around Pilgrim’s Rest have been ongoing for years, since a tender scandal erupted there in 2012.  The once-thriving tourist destination of Pilgrim’s Rest had since fallen into a state of disrepair. All that is about to change.  Kholwane said he was awaiting a report from the Mpumalanga Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, which is in charge of the town. “We need to stop asking about business plans as government. It derails the progress of emerging entrepreneurs. In Pilgrim’s Rest we are planning to give people longer contracts to work there and revive that place. We are going to work with everyone.  We are aware about the injustices of the past, but it time to move on as a country,” he said.
