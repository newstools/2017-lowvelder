MBOMBELA &#8211; A young woman was left in shock when she was hospitalised on her 19th birthday this weekend, and traces of drugs were found in her blood.Drugs she claims she never knowingly took, and she is sure her drink was spiked. She shared her story with Lowvelder, but wishes not to be identified, in an effort to warn other women. Warnings she was aware of beforehand, but did not heed on the night in question.Sally* celebrated her birthday with her friends at a local pub last week when a man offered to buy her a drink.&#8220;I would not normally accept it, but I figured it was an innocent offer since it was my birthday,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I went to the bathroom while he queued at the bar. He had the drinks ready when I returned.&#8221; The man had ordered two shots, which she presumed to be vodka, and clear-coloured drinks, which she thought to be vodka and sprite.&#8220;I drank one of the shots before we left the bar area. I didn&#8217;t think anything of it at the time, but he did not drink the second shot. We moved to a seating area outside, around the corner. I took about two sips of my drink when I felt my arms and legs go numb, and from there the rest of the evening became a blur.&#8221; Sally&#8217;s friend found her with the man, saw the state she was in, and took her to the bathroom.Another friend, Pieter*, not his real name, was phoned by the barman of the pub.&#8220;He told me Sally needed to be taken to hospital. When I arrived, they brought her out to the parking lot, and I took her to the hospital straight away,&#8221; said Pieter. &#8220;I woke up in hospital. After they had some blood tests done, the doctor said my blood-alcohol level had been below the legal limit, but they found a combination of tik and cocaine in my system,&#8221; said Sally. Pieter said it was clear to him that she was not drunk. &#8220;There was a clear difference between her and someone who is drunk,&#8221; he said.Sally claimed that she could not remember what the drinks tasted like or what the man&#8217;s name was, but does remember his appearance.&#8220;I have terrible headaches, and I can still see him in my mind&#8217;s eye clearly,&#8221; Sally stated. Marina Erasmus, director of Sanca Lowveld, said cocaine and tik are an unlikely combination when it comes to spiking drinks.&#8220;Cocaine and tik are both stimulants that keep you awake and energetic. Alcohol is a depressant. People often take cocaine or tik to &#8216;sober up&#8217; when they drink. It is, however, not impossible that the brain can get confused and shuts down to protect itself.&#8221;
