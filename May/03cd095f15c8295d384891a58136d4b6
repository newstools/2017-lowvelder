MBOMBELA &#8211; The executive head of Penryn, Chris Erasmus, confirmed that the World Anti-Doping Agency&#8217;s Gent Laboratory reported the presence of prohibited substances in these learners&#8217; urine samples.It is believed that the school decided to have the youths tested, since they displayed a rapid growth in size. The pupils had to give their consent before being tested.&#8220;They have been suspended from playing sport with immediate effect,&#8221; said Erasmus. &#8220;We are unable to divulge any information pertaining to the individuals. All information; such as their names, grades, the sport they used to participate in and the particulars of their cases; is considered confidential in this regard.&#8220;As a school, Penryn is serious about protecting our pupils and ensuring drug-free sport, hence we are registered with the South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport (Saids), which conducts random tests at Penryn,&#8221; said Erasmus.The use of prohibited substances is very common among learners who participate in sport, according to Ho rskool Nelspruit&#8217;s sport psychologist, Charl Naud . He said parents put immense pressure on the athletes. &#8220;Parents live their dreams through their kids. For their children to stand out above the rest turns to an obsession. Prohibited substance abuse in schools is becoming more common. How we are going to solve this problem, I don&#8217;t know. But it is a fight that we need to keep on fighting,&#8221; said Naud .It is notable that children also take steroids behind their parents&#8217; back.Steroids: what&#8217;s all the rage about? Anabolic steroids are a form of synthetic testosterone that is illegally used to improve aesthetic appearance, increase muscle size, strength and recovery time. There are very limited, specific medical cases for which anabolic steroids might be used as a treatment, and a doctor&#8217;s prescription would be required.Pharmacist at Mopani, Sarah-Anne Mitha explained the impact steroids have mentally and on the cardiovascular system.&#8220;Mentally, steroids can have a massive impact on the brain, causing mood swings, depression, delusions, concentration problems and extreme aggression. Severe acne, an oily scalp, excessive bodily and facial hair, and baldness can also be identified soon after starting steroid use. Another consequence is the development of breasts in males.&#8221;Moving on to the cardiovascular system, one of the most dangerous and ignored of the side effects is the effect steroids have on blood pressure and cholesterol. These two terrors, working together, can lead to heart attacks and strokes. And then of course, a commonly joked about, but never admitted to side effect: testicular shrinkage.Testicular shrinkage and infertility are extremely common side effects,&#8221; said Mitha.What can you do as a parent to combat steroid use: Be informed and talk openly Be aware of the signs of steroid use: sudden increase in muscle mass, acne, stretch marks, disproportionate upper body development, puffy face Steroids cost money: take note of what your child is spending money on and where Help build self-esteem and be aware of unrealistic self-image expectations among boys and men Know about alternatives and safe supplementation.
