MBOMBELA &#8211; South Africans will continue to have to count their pennies for a while, as the global political climate is looking cloudy with a very small chance of sun. This is according to expert economist Jeff Gable.He was the main speaker at the Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism&#8217;s (KLCBT) most recent business networking breakfast, hosted by Absa on May 18.&#8220;Consumer confidence is down and the business environment is bad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been receiving bad news for the last seven to eight years, and it is not about to get any better.&#8221; Gable explained that with president of the United States, Donald Trump&#8217;s views on putting America first by manufacturing and producing goods themselves, it may spell trouble for countries like South Africa.&#8220;We mainly export goods, and now it appears that the US will not be buying from us for much longer.&#8221; He went on to state that, even though the country was almost bankrupt, things got better in the 2000s, only to turn for the worse after 2010, and only some of it can be blamed on the drought.&#8220;Agriculture shrunk by a sixth of its previous year&#8217;s size in 2015, due to the immense drought, and the inflation they tell you is happening does not reflect in the homes of the average household. It is appearing to be much higher.&#8221; Gable explained that not only the poor are feeling the pinch, but that those in middle- and higher-class incomes are not spending as much as they used to either.&#8220;People are not keen to buy a new car, and things like a fancy refrigerator or a coffee machine are just not in the cards for many. Those who earn more will tell you they are comfortable, but they are not as confident.&#8221; Statistics show there are four main reasons why businesses are not expanding; their labour force, interest rates, insufficient demand and political climate.&#8220;The past three and a half years, the political climate was more damaging to the growth of businesses in South Africa, than in the years of 1993 and 1994. That is how bad it really is,&#8221; said Gable. He added that the future is uncertain, but that everything will be clearer by the same time next year.&#8220;We have to wait and see what the leaders of the world are doing. There are a lot of cases in the courts, and laws and constitution may be facing challenges and change. We have to ride out the storm, but we can expect some clarity and certainty on how long this bad run will last by mid-2018.&#8221; He concluded that people will have to sit tight, and stay positive, &#8220;We have been in the mindset of junk status long before it was official.&#8221;
