GRASKOP &#8211; Early in the mornings, over the past few weeks, a large number of pigs have started feasting on the trash dumped at the site. An eyewitness said there are many large pigs and they seemed well-fed.A local trash collector on the site told Lowvelder on Wednesday morning they are from the area and believed to belong to people living around the informal dump site.Another eyewitness raised concerns over the trash heap creeping ever closer to the road between Graskop and Hazyview, on which she travels to work everyday.&#8220;Each day, we pass the spot where the rubbish is dumped,&#8221; she said. It is located about three kilometres from Graskop on the right-hand side of the road.&#8220;There are now about 40 pigs eating from the rubbish and the other morning they were sleeping there too. It is absolutely disgusting,&#8221; she said.It is unclear what steps Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM) is taking to ward off the pigs, and to manage the site.Spokesman for TLCM, Mr Puleng Mapheto did not respond to the newspaper&#8217;s request for comment at the time of going to press.Photos: Nicolene OlckersDevelopers break ground on 51-metre glass elevatorGraskop sanctuary in need of a Good SamaritanNotorious troublemaker busted during poaching raidLowvelder story tip-off
