MBOMBELA &#8211; More than 5 000 people converged on St Peter&#8217;s School for an event called Ephphata. The Hebrew word means, &#8220;to open the heavens&#8221;. It was organised by the Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) church.All branches and ECG submitting branches in Mpumalanga were invited to the event, which lasted from 09:00 to 18:00.&#8220;We had people from Swaziland, Mozambique and all over Mpumalanga join, as it is close by,&#8221; explained church secretary, Mr Linda Mwale. &#8220;We are not just some little church somewhere. We are an international movement of God. We have branches in every province in the country, in the USA, Europe, India and Dubai.&#8221;At around 15:00, residents living around the school started complaining about the noise.One posted on Nelspruiters, &#8220;What on earth is happening at St Peter&#8217;s? The music is so loud we can&#8217;t hear what&#8217;s happening in our own home,&#8221; to which another commented, &#8220;I think we must draft a petition to St Peter&#8217;s before it is every Sunday&#8221;.Another added, &#8221; If that&#8217;s how some of you worship, by upsetting the surrounding neighbourhood, then how Christian is that? Glad I don&#8217;t belong to this group.&#8221;Others mentioned that it was so disturbing, their guests had to leave, and that &#8220;God&#8217;s hearing is perfect and that He did not need amplifiers&#8221;.St Peter&#8217;s principal, Mr Jacques Janse van Rensburg said those who complained were culturally insensitive.&#8220;They have no problem with noise when it caters to their own festivals, but they will complain when people come together in worship.&#8221;&#8220;To each their own, if they want that, but the community must not straitjacket those in worship,&#8221; said Mwale.The ECG said the date for its next event has not yet been confirmed, but undertook that it would certainly happen again in the future.&#8220;We had testimonies of healing and miracles, right in the middle of the service. The noise level of a miracle is pretty high, as God and the angels need noise to be provoked!&#8221; Salvation concluded.Also read: Gallery: It is time compilation&nbsp;
