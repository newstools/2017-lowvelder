The Sudwala Caves are the oldest in the world, formed some 3 000 million years ago. As a visitor, you can venture 600 metres into the caves and 150 metres underground. You should not feel claustrophobic, however, with the central chamber of the cavern complex being big enough to fit a 500-seat concert hall.On Saturday evening it will become just that when UPSO will perform together with award-winning guitarist, singer-songwriter and stage artist, Leon Gropp, and highly-acclaimed conductor, Matheu Kieswetter.It promises to be a treat for the ear and a colour sensation for the eye.Don&#8217;t miss: UPDATE: Last of Kruger 5 most likely found his way across N4Gropp is known for being one half of the internationally-successful guitar duo CH2 but also for his unique cross-over, fusion style of music as a solo artist.Kieswetter is an influential advocate for music education and a champion of new music, having established his own contemporary ensemble, the &#8220;Ubuntu Consort&#8221; and conducted many premiers including operas, one-act ballets and film scores. He has conducted orchestras across the globe.Khuzwayo said UPSO is honoured to be working with such musical greats. She added that much of the music on the programme had been specifically-commissioned for the Sudwala Caves concert and that a lot of Gropp&#8217;s music is newly-written.&#8220;We are playing with a South African sound, even if not all of the music is locally sourced. We urge people to bring the whole family along as it will be something completely different and refreshing,&#8221; Khuzwayo said.We don&#8217;t want people to see orchestral music as only for the upper crust of society in an unavailable space. This music is for everyone.&#8221; She said both Gropp and Kieswetter shared history with UPSO which made the event extremely special.Also read: Young man s love of music thrives against all odds&#8220;But the really special thing is the orchestra consists not only of music students but doctors and engineers and students from other professions in training, and our Believe group offers people without hope the chance to better their circumstances and play in a semi-professional orchestra,&#8221; Khuzwayo said. You can witness UPSO and Leon Gropp performing with Matheu Kieswetter as conductor at the Sudwala Cave Amphitheatre, R539 Sabie Road, on May 13.
