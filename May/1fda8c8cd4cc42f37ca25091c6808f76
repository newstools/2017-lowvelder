WHITE RIVER &#8211; &#8220;The way we see it, music is indispensable. It fuels education, boosts self-esteem and promotes a global sense of happiness that&#8217;s hard to beat.&#8221;The academy is holding the next audition for its full-time music course on May 13 and hopes to find those with the &#8220;passion to become professional musicians&#8221;.Also read: Powerhouse Parlotones rocking it away with starry-eyed LowveldersInterested people should be able to play at least one instrument and have a driven interest to work hard and learn all about the music industry. According to Loots, they should love to perform and want to become a star.Loots added that the academy&#8217;s vision is to make the CMDA the music school to go to in the southern hemisphere. &#8220;We would like to build our students to 150 capacity and have facilities for them to produce, manage and record in-house,&#8221; she said.&#8220;In the audition, we have a panel that will look for people with skill, talent and confidence. Those who audition will be judged and interviewed to see if they have the potential to participate in this programme. It is tough, but they will be exposed to so much,&#8221; Loots said.Check out Casterbridge Music Development Academy (CMDA) on Facebook for videos and photosWhen the CMDA opened its doors in 2010, the idea was to provide a platform for local children &#8211; especially from previously disadvantaged backgrounds &#8211; to develop an interest in music and the performing arts. It was an idea the founders hoped would impact their lives positively.Over the years, the CMDA has produced a high calibre of musicians and bands who can boast having performed alongside international acts as well as several local South African greats. When the students are not rubbing shoulders with well-known local musicians, they spend their free time preparing for performances at corporate, private and public events, including several local festivals in the Lowveld area.Some of the highlights for the students and staff include April&#8217;s workshop with South African rock group The Parlotones and singer-songwriter, Paige Mac, recording her new songs in the CMDA studio.&#8220;At the songwriting workshop and show with The Parlotones, students were able to interact with the musicians and assist them with sound, lights and the many aspects of bringing a show of that calibre to the public.&#8221;&#8220;Paige Mac also worked closely with the students, teaching them about the music industry,&#8221; Loots explained.The academy&#8217;s students have been writing their own songs weekly, recording them and posting them to YouTube and other social- media sites. Loots said it gives them a lot of exposure.&#8220;We will also give our musicians exposure through a wonderful show about the history of South African music, which we will start performing every Friday night at the Barnyard Theatre for locals and tourists. It will be an ongoing show, and proceeds will go towards the students earning a little money and gaining experience,&#8221; she said.The CMDA is always looking for sponsors to invest in its one-of-a-kind programme. Registration for the audition at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre is at 09:00 on May 13. Latecomers will have to wait for the next audition in June, so do not miss out.
