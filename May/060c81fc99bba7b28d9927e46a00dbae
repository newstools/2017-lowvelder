MBOMBELA &#8211; Coca-Cola Nelspruit launched a brand-new campaign to support small-business owners in the city centre last week.It handed 42 branded trolleys with built-in cooler boxes and branded umbrellas to street vendors working in and around the taxi rank on Tuesday morning.The soft-drink giant aims to sponsor more than 2 000 trolleys to vendors nationwide. Business consultant, Eduardo Dias explained that the vendors will benefit from the project. In the past they had to buy stock and ice to keep produce cold, and the mark-up was high.&#8220;We now offer them a supply of products at a more wholesale price and negotiated to get them free ice, so they would not have to add it to the consumer price,&#8221; said Dias. He also explained that the trolleys were on a &#8220;loan&#8221; basis, saying, &#8220;If we find out that you are selling alcohol or drugs using our branded trolleys, you are out. We reserve the right to take it away if it is misused&#8221;. Rewarding hard workers is also part of the initiative. The vendor who sells the most soft drinks each month will be rewarded with three cases of products, the second-best seller will get two cases, and one case will be given the person in third place.The customer manager for local trade, Curnick Tshongweni, stated that, &#8220;We do not create jobs, these vendors do. They were already here, working. If we help them and they sell more, they create a higher demand and we will in turn be able to hire more people. &#8220;The more people who have jobs and can make a living, the less people will have to steal or resort to drugs.&#8221; Tshongweni said that he hoped for a growth in entrepreneurship and that children will learn to be as resourceful as their parents, and that the projects can relieve some of the pressure on the government to create jobs.One vendor, Zodwa Mhlanga, said it was life-changing.&#8220;Now we can sell cold products at reasonable prices and we are properly branded to be seen from far away. This is all we could ask for, to be a successful street vendor,&#8221; she said.
