MBOMBELA &#8211; A jewellery store was robbed while another deterred the robbery at Riverside Mall earlier tonight.A witness recalled how 10 armed men, wearing balaclavas entered the mall at around 18:00. I was in a nearby store when I saw the men running towards Arthur Kaplan and Browns Jewellers, the witness said.It is believed that the latter s security system created smoke during the attempted robbery, thus deterring it. I heard numerous gunshots and saw how they hit the Browns security guard at the back of his head.They gained entrance to Arthur Kaplan, put the jewellery in a bag, then put it in a trolley and ran out the door. They took the guards wallet and cellphone before they fled. We saw two vehicles, a black Mercedes-Benz and a white Audi waiting for the suspects outside, she said.Both vehicles believed to have been used during the robbery, have apparently just been located near the Disaster Management Centre.
