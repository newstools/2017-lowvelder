Ettiene Oosthuizen:&#8220;So a 5 month project finally complete&#8230; The downsize destroyed the quality a little, but I am over all still very happy with it. A timelapse video done from a single Koppie or hilltop in the center of Nelspruit South Africa.It was shot entirely with a Fujifilm XT2, with a range of lenses, 10-20mm f/4, 18-55 f/2.8-4 and the 50-140mm f/2.8 XF. I edited it with Adobe Lightroom, in conjunction with the free version of LRTimelapse.&#8221;Visit Etienne&#8217;s website to see more of his work.
