PRETORIA &#8211; &#8220;Justice has prevailed,&#8221; Phosa said. &#8220;The court ruling this morning has proven my innocence. I was telling the truth and Mabuza was lying all along.&#8221;Mabuza initially claimed R10 million from Phosa for allegedly defaming him by passing on a report, alleging that Mabuza was an apartheid-era spy, to the ANC leadership.Mabuza also claimed that Phosa fabricated the report himself. His legal team later indicted his would accept R1 million in damages, and a public apology.Phosa denied this, saying he was given the report anonymously, and that it was his duty to inform the party leadership to investigate.The former premier, who recently announced he would be accept a proposed nomination as ANC president, also approached the court to expedite the case.Judge Mr Bill Prinsloo set aside Mabuza&#8217;s application with costs earlier today.He said the basis of the case was that Phosa authored the spy report, which he disseminated with the intention of injuring Mabuza&#8217;s good name.He, however, could not prove this, and the judge ruled that the evidence provided by Mr Jan Venter, on which Mabuza relied, was poor and the &#8220;self-confessed liar, has no credibility.
