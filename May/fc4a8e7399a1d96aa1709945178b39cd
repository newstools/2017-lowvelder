BARBERTON &#8211; Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyarende were in a lamp-room container which fell into a sinkhole created by a collapsed crown pillar. Their families received R200 000 each.The 87 mine workers who were rescued each received R10 000, with a promised R40 000 still expected to be paid.Cosatu made the announcement last Wednesday during a community meeting held at Louieville Thusong Service Centre. Mosobenzi Zwane, minister of mineral resources, promised the compensation to the workers last year. David Thabo Mokoena, acting Cosatu provincial secretary, said that Lily Mine and the Department of Mineral Resources have compensated the families of the trapped and injured miners as promised.Christopher Mazibuko, the husband of Pretty Nkambule, confirmed that the family received the money.&#8220;The money was paid into my mother-in-law&#8217;s account. I do not know the reason it was done like that, and if I had my way I would prefer that the money be sent to a trust fund account. I want my children to be able to use the funds when they are older. I do not want it in my account either, because the money is for the children,&#8221; said Mazibuko.&#8220;As Cosatu we are glad they were compensated, although we still want the outstanding R40 000 to be paid since the miners were promised R50 000. The company that will take over operations at Lily Mine needs to also prioritise the repatriation of the bodies of the trapped in the mine. They must make sure the remains are found and given to the families,&#8221; said Mokoena.Vantage Goldfields&#8217; Lily and Barbrook mines have since been placed under business rescue, and mining operations have ceased.Mokoena said Cosatu remained adamant that if the company continued with operations in future, former employees should get first preference to be rehired.
