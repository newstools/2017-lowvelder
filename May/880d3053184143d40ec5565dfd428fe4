MBOMBELA &#8211; The Department of Health has issued a malaria warning after two people in Mpumalanga are suspected to have died of the illness over the past two weeks.Spokesman Mr Dumisani Malamule said the 585 cases reported in the past month was way more than the 499 reported in the same period last year.Malamule said 235 of a total of 294 cases in Bushbuckridge were local transmissions and not imported from Limpopo and neighbouring countries, Mozambique and Zimbabwe where malaria is endemic.The Malaria Journal on Biomedcentral.com reports on the strategy to eliminate malaria in the country by 2018. Since 2012, South Africa has officially transitioned from controlling the disease to the goal of eradicating it within its borders, but recent statistics show that more effort will be needed to achieve the goal.&nbsp;Acting director of communicable disease control, Mr Mandla Zwane explained that eradicating the disease will be difficult as it is often imported from elsewhere. Therefore eliminating local transmissions is where the goal for 2018 lies.&#8220;We have to educate people on how to prevent it within our borders. We&#8217;ve had a long drought, and recent rains have influenced the number of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. All is not lost, we will just have to come up with new strategies and put in a bit more effort,&#8221; Zwane told Lowvelder.Dr Allison Blair from WeCare Medical Practice at Lowveld Hospital urged people to take a blood test at a laboratory at the earliest symptoms. &#8220;There are pharmacy test kits to use at home, but they are not as effective as a blood test.&#8221;If a patient tests positive for malaria, the parasite count will determine the treatment.&#8220;If the parasite count is high, an oral treatment to be taken at home may be prescribed. Should it be very high, an IV-drip and hospitalisation may be needed. The problem is often secondary side effects such as kidney failure,&#8221; she said.Blair says prevention is better than cure, and cheaper too.&#8220;Before going into areas where malaria is prevalent, make sure to get preventative medication as well as products to ward off the anopheles mosquito, that carries the parasite.&#8221;Sr Hazel van Staden from Mopani Pharmacy clinic says symptoms can start a couple of days after being in an area where malaria is prevalent, but it can show up to 30 days later. There are three types of prophylaxis to use, but it is best to have a full consultation to make sure that the brand you pick, is not contra-indicated by any other medication you may be taking.
