MBOMBELA &#8211; Marlize Pennells, an employee of the SPCA told Lowvelder it was not clear how the kitten got there.&#8220;A man came in, and told us a kitten was stuck behind the fender of his vehicle. The man came from Kaapsehoop when he discovered the kitten, and was not sure where she came from. Celia Sutton, an inspector, practically took the bakkie apart to get the kitten out.&#8221;The baby is approximately seven weeks old, appeared to be unharmed and will remain at Nelspruit SPCA.
