MBOMBELA &#8211; Childline Mpumalanga (CLMPU) is a non-profit organisation, and needs assistance from the public to successfully render its services to those in need. The organisation is calling on the community to join as board members.The positions would require them to attend around six meetings &#8211; after working hours &#8211; per year, and to complete projects assigned to them.&#8220;We are looking for someone to fill the secretarial, marketing and communications, and fund-raising positions. It is not a job offer. It is completely voluntary and will not interfere with your day job,&#8221; Dr Benita Nel, director of CLMPU, explained. Childline does not only rely on donated funds, but also on the actual time, effort and passion of people. The NGO offers services to an average of 20 000 children every year. Some kids receive more than one need at a time. Parents, including those who are teens, are offered guidance in parenting skills.With the change in times, comes change in a child&#8217;s behaviour. &#8220;Children are different from how they were 20 years ago. From the age of three months they are already plopped in front of a television set. We are not just thinking outside the box, we have to use the box now!&#8221; Filo Mooney, chairman of the board said, &#8220;It is important that we fill these voluntary positions, because we need a full crew to make sure the organisation is run in accordance with the law and ethical standards. I am here to double-check every large financial decision made, to ensure that the funding Childline gets is put to good use,&#8221; said Mooney.&#8220;The positions are available to those with some creative thoughts in their minds, some time on their hands, and passion in their hearts.&#8221; If you wish to apply, contact Nel on benita@childlinempu.org.za.
