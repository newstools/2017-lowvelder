MBOMBELA &#8211; The Grace Family Fellowship church will celebrate its third birthday on Sunday.The service will start at 08:30. Ernie Amos will sing for and speak to the congregation. A party will be held afterwards to celebrate three years of growth and healing.&#8220;We are a church that allows anyone in, without judgement. We do not follow any formal church denomination. We do not believe in dressing in a particular way or acting in a certain manner. Our congregation calls us by name, not by any title,&#8221; said Kelvin. The church does not make collections.&#8220;No one has to give us anything to come here. We do not expect anyone to give us their &#8216;tenth&#8217;. The church has a bank account that people donate into, but they only do so because they truly want to. We&#8217;ve never asked anyone for money, and we will not start now,&#8221; said Cyzelle. &#8220;We want people to come, have cake, have a chat, and celebrate with us.&#8221; Directions to the church can be found on its website: www.gracefam.co.za, or phone Kelvin on 082-453-0522 for any enquiries.
