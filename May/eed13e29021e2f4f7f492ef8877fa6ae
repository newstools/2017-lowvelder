One of the four conservancies of the GLC is the Sabie Game Reserve (SGR). Here the DAG team is so trusted by the KNP anti-poaching experts, that fences have been dropped on the almost 40-kilometre border between KNP and SGR.Sabie Game Reserve is part of the Greater Lebombo Conservancy.DAG has a well-designed anti-poaching strategy in place.WATCH why the head ranger of the Kruger National Park is in favour of shifting the fenceIt includes day and night patrols of the electrified fence between SGR and the so-called &#8220;poachers&#8217; heaven&#8221; on the other side.Here rhino kingpins park their Pajeros and Land Cruisers at Corner House, a derelict building which serves as a bar at which poachers meet, watch soccer, drink, exchange more than money and obtain poaching muti.

To create a safe haven for all species with a special focus on the protection of rhinos.&#8221;He is proud of the fact that the area his team is protecting is not riddled with snares. No poachers hunt for bush meat in the reserve.He attributed his ability to make a comeback to his philosophy of never giving in to fear.&#8221;Being scared is not an option. Being aware of danger is.&#8221;Sean van NiekerkVan Niekerk grew up in Louis Trichardt, obtained a B. Comm-degree at the University of Pretoria and then went to Wildlife College in the KNP.
