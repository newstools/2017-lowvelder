MBOMBELA &#8211; The Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association (Lefpa) is hard at work preparing for this year&#8217;s fire season. Two specialised trainers from the USA facilitated training courses in the Lowveld last week.They represented the New York City Fire Department (NYCFD), and United States Force Service (USFS). Trainees came from the Eastern Cape, Piet Retief, Warburton and Mbombela Fire Protection Association (FPA) branches.The five-day courses were funded by the United States Agency for International Development (Usaid), and centred on aircraft dispatch and incident command systems (ICS) respectively.ICS manages responses to long-term and large-scale disasters, such as large veld fires, terrorism-related incidents, natural disasters and disease outbreaks.&#8220;It is essentially the management of organised responses that bring order to chaos,&#8221; said Mike Meyers, chief of the NYCFD. &#8220;It brings structure, and minimises the duplication of efforts. It streamlines the efficiency of allocating resources, with safety as the forefront of the operation.&#8221; Aircraft dispatch relates to the coordination of different aircraft and setting a standardised method.&#8220;In the United States, I can work everywhere in the country, because we all learn to do it exactly the same way, so everyone understands,&#8221; explained Kim Thomas, USFS representative. &#8220;Here, every FPA district has a different method, and that makes it difficult to move across regions to do the same work.&#8221; The trainees practised hypothetical scenarios, such as fighting fires in a high-value timber plantation and a residential area. They also had to make hard choices.&#8220;Sometimes, two areas of equal value are in danger, and dispatch teams need to be able to work out where a fire can be contained and extinguished the most effectively,&#8221; said Thomas.
