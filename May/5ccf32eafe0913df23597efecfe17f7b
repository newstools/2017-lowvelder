Almost 90% of South African motorists believe obedience of the laws of the road has gotten worse since 2015. And, according to a recent survey conducted in April on 1 000 drivers by the Automobile Association (AA), almost 75% of driver believe the attitude of motorists towards one another has deteriorated over this period. In Mpumalanga, 83% of drivers believe non-compliance is getting worse while in the Northern Cape and North West provinces, 100% of drivers hold the same opinion. These results are actually quite breath-taking as they seem to indicate, once again, that most motorists believe the problems on South African roads are someone else s fault. Given our country s high Easter road fatality rate, this attitude implies not enough motorists are taking responsibility for their actions, which is worrying, the AA noted.Results also show that nationally, just over 55% of motorists believe visible policing on roads has also declined, with only 13% of respondents stating they think it has improved since 2015.Here are the national results.

In Gauteng, only 10% said conditions were improving, while 67% said they are getting worse.Faulty traffic lights are also a major concern, especially in metropolitan areas where faulty lights in the morning and afternoon add to congestion and other traffic problems. Among the respondents, 45% said the situation with faulty traffic lights is getting worse, while 40% said the issue remains unchanged and 13% of respondents said it is improving. This survey again highlights that too many drivers believe road traffic laws don t apply to them, which, when combined with what is perceived to be lower police visibility, is perhaps part of the reason for our country s high road fatality statistics.Unless driver attitudes improve, in addition to more effective policing, the carnage on South African roads will continue unabated, the AA concluded.
