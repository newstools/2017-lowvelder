In the one-kilometre open-water event, she even beat &#8220;all the boys&#8221; to win.Esterhuizen only took up Masters swimming last year, although she has swum in a number of local galas and open-water events over the past few years.Competitive swimming has been in her blood from a young age when she &#8220;gave it a bash&#8221; at nine years old at a club in Harare, Zimbabwe. A year later she was chosen to represent the province, and at just 12 years old, it was her country, at the Luxembourg youth meet.

You can&#8217;t worry about anything else, it&#8217;s just you and the water,&#8221; Esterhuizen explains. &#8220;But you have to be very motivated to do something in this sport; you need to have goals and stick to them.&#8221; Photo: James Munroe&nbsp;
