MBOMBELA -Two men appeared briefly in the Nelspruit Magistrate Court on Tuesday regarding the shooting of two petrol attendants over the weekend. Tshepo Mashigo (32) and Joseph Lubisi (31) are charged with attempted murder and murder.The incident took place at the Shell Filling Station in Andrew Street. There were three staff members on duty that night, Innocent Mhlabane, Thulani Matjelele and Eric Mhlaba.Mhlabane said a gold Ford Fiesta with two men arrived at the station. They went in to the convenience store to buy cigarettes and food. &#8220;They left and then later came back. I could hear them shouting and accusing the attendants outside of taking R100.&#8221;Police spokesman, Capt Dawie Pretorius said one suspect walked to his vehicle and took out a firearm. &#8220;He shot the two attendants at close range. He and the man with him then got into their vehicle and fled the scene,&#8221; said Pretorius.&#8220;I was inside attending to a customer when I heard the gunshots. I dove for cover. When I heard the car drive off I found Matjelele and Mhlaba on the floor bleeding,&#8221; said Mhlabane.Shell Filling Station manager, Mike Mandlazi said Mhlaba died instantly and Matjelele was in a critical but stable condition in hospital. &#8220;He had an operation on Sunday,&#8221; said Mandlazi.Hi-Tech Emergency Services paramedic, Strini Ramea, responded to the call. &#8220;When I got there I saw attendants sprawled in front of the garage shop door,&#8221; said Ramea. He was told that the one man was already dead. &#8220;I immediately started treating the man who was still breathing. He had a gunshot wound on the left side of his chest and one through his mouth. He was critical.&#8221; Ramea said they stabilised the attendant and transported him to Mediclinic Nelspruit.Mandlazi said this was the first time anything like this had happened at their station. He said he wanted to send his condolences to Mhlaba&#8217;s family and friends. The victim&#8217;s cousin, James Mdaka who also works at the filling station, said the family was shocked and traumatised by the news. &#8220;He was only 26 years old and had been working here for the past three years.&#8221;Later the same day, the police arrested Mashigo. &#8220;He led the police to Lubisi&#8217;s house. There the SAPS found Lubisi with an unlicensed firearm in his possession,&#8221; said Pretorius.The case was postponed until Monday June 5.
