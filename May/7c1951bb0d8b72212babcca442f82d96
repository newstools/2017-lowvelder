Arine Prins said that she has not received any feedback from the police. Her husband was laid to rest on May 3 in the Netherlands. Van Es and Prins were originally from the Netherlands, but moved to South Africa many years ago.On April 8, Van Es (55) was brutally killed and his wife, Prins and a friend, Michael Watt, were assaulted by five armed men. The suspects entered the house shortly after 20:00. Prins said that she had hoped that by the time she returned home there would be some information about the attack.The late Peet van Es&#8220;I have forwarded them emails with information about personal things that were stolen and did not receive any response. &#8220;They all have my email address but it seems they are busy with other things rather than solving a murder case,&#8221; said Prins.&#8220;I have heard nothing about the case and I think I have the right to know what exactly happened to my husband. I feel very frustrated about the incompetence of the Barberton police. I have received no follow ups and no communication at all,&#8221; said Prins. &#8220;I am back from overseas and for now we survive day by day.Arine Prins and a family friend were assaulted during the farm attackEvery day a small step,&#8221; said Prins. Barberton Times contacted the police about Prins&#8217; concerns. Capt Jabu Ndubane from the local SAPS said that she did a follow up and she was informed that there is no need for Prins to go to the media. She has the contact details of the investigating officer and if she is not happy the doors are always open.She can come to the police station. She can talk to the branch commander and station commander,&#8221; said Ndubane.
