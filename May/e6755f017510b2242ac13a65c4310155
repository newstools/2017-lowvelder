MBOMBELA &#8211; Many residents have raised concerns for public safety on the Lowveld&#8217;s roads, as it appears nothing is being done by authorities to curb the problem.According to several sources, the cattle, which are regularly seen on the N4 and Kaapsehoop Road, allegedly belong to the Matsafeni Mdluli Trust.Lowvelder has been unable to confirm these claims.Buys, her husband, Doep, and an employee were travelling from the city to their second property in Kaapsehoop when two cattle ran across their path. The bigger one of the two knocked the smaller one onto the bonnet of the Subaru, damaging it and the side-view mirror on the driver&#8217;s side.Buys confirmed that her insurance had been in touch with Roy Mdluli.&#8220;He told them it cannot be proven that the cattle belong to him. Since the accident, however, I have not seen any cattle roaming on the Kaapsehoop Road, so maybe creating a little awareness has helped,&#8221; Buys said.The vehicle incurred R128 000 in damages, and the repairs are being covered by her insurance.John Meintjies, vice-chairman of Mbombela&#8217;s Community Police Forum (CPF), said the issue of stray cattle on the city&#8217;s roads has long been a problem.Also read: Beast on the bonnet damages new vehicle&#8220;The matter has been raised in two of the recent subforum meetings. The great logistical challenge is that there is no local facility in which to keep the animals if they are removed from the road,&#8221; he explained.&#8220;The Mbombela Traffic Department came to the party at the last meeting and the interim solution is for it respond to the traffic issues late at night or in misty conditions. If there is a threat of cattle causing an accident, members of the public can call the 24-hour control-room number.&#8221;The City of Mbombela&#8217;s 24-hour control-room number is 013-753-3331.The municipality recently distributed a notice of &#8220;grave concern&#8221; to various stakeholders.It said owners of animals are obligated to exercise control over their animals by ensuring they do do not stray onto public roads, and highlighted the lack of identification on many of the animals, which is also an offence punishable by law.Also read: Tracking and patrols game-changer for anti-poaching&#8220;Non-adherence (to either regulation) may lead to the impounding of the animals and issuing of a minimum fine of R1 000. The owner will be held liable for damages caused by the animals and pound fees,&#8221; it read.Lowvelder is aware of only one such facility in the Lowveld located in Lydenburg.Mdluli would not take Lowvelder&#8217;s calls or respond to text messages.When asked if he headed the Matsafeni Mdluli Trust, he categorically denied this and said there were many people who owned cattle in the area.
