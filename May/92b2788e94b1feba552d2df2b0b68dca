MBOMBELA &#8211; The average take-home salary has risen by 2,2% from last year. For the second consecutive month, salaries also rose by 1,1% in April, however, this was a bit lower than March s increase of 1,3%. The average banked salary of R13 755 has increased by R148 since April last year. This is attributed to a higher inflation rate on which current salary increases are based. The nominal average salary rose by 7,3% to R13 958 in April on a year-on-year basis. This represented a R945 increase in nominal terms, BankservAfrica said. Although disposable salary increases usually drive retail sales, the growth in real personal taxes paints a bleak picture for durable sales which could be stymied by low consumer confidence, said Mike Sch ssler, chief economist at Economists dotcoza. The middle nominal salary was R10 236, an improvement of R787 compared to a year ago. Discussing recent negotiations on minimum-wages for May 2018 and the possible impact on disposable salaries Sch ssler said that only 14% of the salaries measured in the BDSI are below R4 000 per month, suggesting that the execution of the minimum wages will be felt among smaller firms. BankservAfrica added that, while its BDSI data is not as representative of small firms with less than 40 or 50 employees. It is unlikely that the current discussions on the minimum wage implementation will have an impact; Less than 10% of employees currently earn a gross income of less than R3 500. Current discussions on the minimum-wage implementation will probably not impact more than 5% of full-time employees in larger companies or the state, it said.
