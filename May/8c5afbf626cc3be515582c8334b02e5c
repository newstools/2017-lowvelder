MBOMBELA &#8211; Dr Mathews Phosa announced on Saturday that he would accept the nomination to become ANC president in December. Nominations officially open in June.&#8220;I want people to know that I am available,&#8221; he told Lowvelder on Sunday.Mathews Phosa for president?He said the country needed a clean leader, free of scandals and corruption. He said announcements from more branches could be expected, but he would not divulge details.&#8220;I have support all over the country. We are busy. We are working very hard&#8221;.He has been highly critical of the ruling party&#8217;s leadership and has called on Zuma to resign a number of times.&#8220;Enough I say, enough! &#8211; PhosaHe did so again during his speech at Freedom Day celebrations in Langa on Saturday. He told supporters there was little to celebrate.&#8220;The past years and months have been increasingly depressing for me personally as I have witnessed a once-proud, focused and visionary party and movement disintegrate into utterly shameful and embarrassing shambles.&#8220;Where previously I had remained silent out of loyalty to my beloved ANC, I now have to acknowledge that this is not the ANC that I know and to which I, and thousands of others, have dedicated our lives. And so I must, and I will, continue to speak out. Silence is connivance.&#8220;Failure to act now will leave us drifting further down the slope to nowhere, and before long the forces of history will simply wash us away. I cannot believe the comrades of our movement would ever allow that to happen,&#8221; he concluded.Premier at loggerheads with PhosaLowvelder story tip-off
