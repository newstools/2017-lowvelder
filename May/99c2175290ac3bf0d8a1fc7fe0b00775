MBOMBELA &#8211; A local&#8217;s love for making cheesecake led to her having the opportunity to stock her grocery cupboards for free.Judie Rossouw won this free spree as part of a Lancewood&#8217;s promotional campaign, after buying cream cheese from their brand.During the dash, Rossouw grabbed various dairy products, meat and a couple of coffee tins, ending the final countdown with a tub of mayonnaise.Lancewood paid for the grand total, which amounted to just under R3000.&#8220;I am definitely making a Lancewood cheesecake with the cream cheese, it was my very first thought when I started the dash! This is really an amazing gift, especially to receive it in the middle of the month,&#8221; said Rossouw.
