MBOMBELA &#8211; They also called for investigations &#8220;into the lease and land sold by the club to the Matumi housing estate&#8221;, the rates and taxes paid by NGC and the water rights given to the club.Marchers wearing EFF red, the green and yellow of Ancyl and white T-shirts with Sanco printed across the chest, gathered in their hundreds for what was termed an anti-racism protest, prompted by the October incident which saw the then 19-year-old Jabulane Mabilane assaulted on the golf course. Ancyl and EFF protesters marched separately, and organisation leaders handed over two different memoranda to Nelspruit Golf Club management and executive mayor, Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi.Their messages, however, were very similar: immediately transform the golf club for equitable opportunities across all racial lines, make membership fees affordable for all, AND take action against the four white golfers involved in the alleged racist assault against the young black golfer.READ and WATCH videos about Friday&#8217;s march: Both memoranda were signed by the mayor and NGC club captain, Zulu Cason. Jabulane Mabilane, Collen Sedibe, Sibusiso Mathonsi and Zulu Cason.&#8220;I am speechless, I appreciate all of you,&#8221; Mabilane said off the back of an EFF bakkie to protesters standing on the ninth hole green in front of the clubhouse.Lowvelder reported extensively on the incident which saw him and one of the four white golfers suspended for 18 months by the club, following a internal disciplinary inquiry. These sanctions were suspended for two years. Mabilane also opened a case against the four men. Cason said, after an appeal, sanctions against Mabilane had been absolved and he was free to play at the club. He added that &#8220;police lethargy&#8221; may have contributed to the protest and the chaos which ensued at the estate.Don&#8217;t tell me that in seven months they couldn&#8217;t have taken these people to court and sorted those charges out? Once that is done, we can know for sure (who the culprits are). Then we can take the matter further,&#8221; Cason told Lowvelder.ANC branch treasurer, Oupa Pilane, also supported the march which happened in the party&#8217;s Ward 17.Monica Nyuswa, spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority, said Mabilane&#8217;s attorney needed to provide further statements pertaining to the case before it could be placed on the court roll.Last week the club confirmed that millionaire, Robert Gumede had withdrawn his sponsorship of more than R1 million due to &#8220;personal reasons&#8221;. It is believed the sponsorship was to be used for the annual Jock of the Bushveld tournament which was hosted by NGC last week. &#8220;What we really do not need in this country is unnecessary racial tension. We were there to support the anti-racism march and to make sure there was minimal damage to club property. As party leadership, I think we made sure the march was a peaceful one,&#8221; Pilane said.Unfortunately, there is a strong feeling that the club did not handle the incident involving Mabilane well. Even if a person is insulted or provoked, it gives that person no right to hit anyone.&#8221;Although the march appeared well organised, it was not without incident.Members of the province&#8217;s public order police resorted to shooting rubber bullets at some protesters who allegedly put tyres in front of the golf estate&#8217;s entrance and were in possession of petrol.After some negotiation between the police and organisation leaders, the march was allowed to go ahead.When the protesters arrived at the entrance gate, they demanded to be let in, even though municipal approval for the march clearly stated that the memoranda be handed over to club management at the entrance/exit gate to the estate.After further negotiations between the mayor, organisation leaders and club management, it was agreed to let the protesters march to the club itself.Some Sanco and Ancyl members raided a drinks tent adjacent to the ninth-hole green before leadership managed to calm them down.WATCH what happened: Protesters raid tee box at Nelspruit golf course &#8220;Management of the club will meet during the week, so that we respond to both memoranda in a timeous manner,&#8221; Cason said.Cason said there was minimal damage to the green where the protesters had congregated, and although play was interrupted for a period on Friday and some play time had to be made up, the Jock of the Bushveld tournament finished on Sunday as scheduled.&nbsp;
