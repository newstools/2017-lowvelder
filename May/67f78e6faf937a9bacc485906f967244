MBOMBELA &#8211; The 81-year-old nun, affiliated to St Peter&#8217;s School, fell and broke a bone in her right arm and her right femur on April 21. The incident occurred in Lowveld Hospital&#8217;s parking lot.Emily was visiting the dentist and arrived at the hospital on her scooter. A car guard ran to assist her to move the scooter to the correct spot after she dismounted.The guard twisted the accelerator by mistake, causing the scooter to jolt forward. As a result it crashed into a car and Emily fell. The guard fell and injured his leg.&#8220;It was so silly, it really was an accident. The people here were so kind and helpful. They admitted me right away. The minute I fell, I knew something was broken,&#8221; she said.Emily had planned to fly to her home country, Austria, on May 6. She wanted to visit her brother to celebrate his 80th birthday.&#8220;He has been diagnosed with cancer and I was so disappointed to learn that I could not go. It was my main concern the day after the accident. The doctor said I&#8217;d only be able to go in August,&#8221; she told Lowvelder.The flight ticket cost R15 000, but it is not clear how much rebooking her ticket will cost. Emily underwent corrective surgery on April 25. A pin was inserted in her leg and a plate in her arm, to help along a straight regrowth.She does not belong to any medical aid. Lowveld Hospital CEO, Mr Armand van der Merwe told the newspaper that he had advised her family that they can put in a claim against the public liability fund of the body corporate of the property. He said it was a sad, freak accident.She is in good spirits, stating that she only experiences pain when she has to get up to go to the bathroom.&#8220;I am grateful for the help I have received. Getting old is not for sissies! I do have lots of life in me still. If you swap my age around I am 18 and not 81,&#8221; she stated.
