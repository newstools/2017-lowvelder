Fortunately, the officer was wearing protective gear,&#8221; Smit said.Smit explained that another officer in the team shone a heavy light and sprayed pepper spray in the man&#8217;s eyes which made him stagger back a few steps.&#8220;This gave the TRT ample time to climb onto the roof via the ladder and secure the man with handcuffs and cable ties around his ankles,&#8221; Smit said.The helicopter then hovered on the roof and the man was put on board and brought back to ground level.Smit said he was taken to a Themba Hospital ward to calm him down.
